A risk register is a critical tool in project management and organisational risk
assessment that serves as a comprehensive repository for identifying,
documenting, and managing potential risks. This dynamic document helps
stakeholders understand the array of possible risks, their likelihood, and their
potential impact on a project or business operation. By systematically
categorising and prioritising risks, the risk register provides a structured
approach to develop mitigation strategies and allocate resources efficiently. It
is an essential component for proactive decision-making, ensuring that all team
members are aware of possible challenges and are prepared to handle them
effectively to minimise negative outcomes and capitalise on opportunities that
may arise from identified risks.
