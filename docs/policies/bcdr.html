<p>The CloudCore Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover CloudCore following a disruption resulting from a disaster. This Disaster Recovery Policy is maintained by the CloudCore Security Officer and Privacy Officer.</p>
<p><strong>HIPAA:</strong> This CloudCore Contingency Plan has been developed as required under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Final Security Rule, Section §164.308(a)(7), which requires the establishment and implementation of procedures for responding to events that damage systems containing electronic protected health information.</p>
<section id="policy-statements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-statements">Policy Statements</h2>
<p>CloudCore policy requires that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A plan and process for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR), including the backup and recovery of systems and data, must be defined and documented.</p></li>
<li><p>BCDR shall be simulated and tested at least once a year. Metrics shall be measured and identified recovery enhancements shall be filed to improve the BCDR process.</p></li>
<li><p>Security controls and requirements must be maintained during all BCDR activities.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bcdr-objectives-and-roles">BCDR Objectives and Roles</h3>
<section id="objectives" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives">Objectives</h4>
<p>The following objectives have been established for this plan:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Maximise the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of the following phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Notification/Activation phase</em> to detect and assess damage and to activate the plan;</li>
<li><em>Recovery phase</em> to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage done to the original system;</li>
<li><em>Reconstitution phase</em> to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out CloudCore processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and define the impact of interruptions to CloudCore systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for recovering CloudCore during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure coordination with other CloudCore staff who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Example of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats, and internal malicious activities.</p>
<p>CloudCore defined two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Critical Systems</em>. These systems host production application servers/services and database servers/services or are required for functioning of systems that host production applications and data. These systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored, or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming unavailable.</li>
<li><em>Non-critical Systems</em>. These are all systems not considered critical by definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a lower priority than critical systems.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notification-and-activation-phase">Notification and Activation Phase</h4>
<p>This phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage inflicted by a disruption to CloudCore. Based on the assessment of the Event, sometimes according to the CloudCore Incident Response Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the COO or Head of Engineering. The Contingency Plan may also be activated by the Security Officer in the event of a cyber disaster.</p>
<p>The notification sequence is listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first responder is to notify the COO. All known information must be relayed to the COO.</p></li>
<li><p>The COO is to contact the Response Teams and inform them of the event. The COO or delegate is responsible to begin assessment procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>The COO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the COO is to following the steps below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Damage Assessment Procedures:</li>
<li>The COO is to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.</li>
<li>Alternate Assessment Procedures:</li>
<li>Upon notification, the COO is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with the Response Teams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The CloudCore Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>CloudCore will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.</li>
<li>On-premise hosting facility or cloud infrastructure service is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.</li>
<li>Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by CloudCore.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the plan is to be activated, the COO is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon notification from the COO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The COO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site.</p></li>
<li><p>The COO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="testing-and-maintenance">Testing and Maintenance</h3>
<p>The COO and/or Head of Engineering shall establish criteria for validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for personnel involved in the plan’s execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will satisfy the annual requirement.</p>

The exercises include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific crisis.</li>

<p>Production data is to be synchronised across multiple S3 buckets in AWS. Additionally, it is backed up to AWS Glacier for long term storage and recovery. In an event that requires data to be recovered, it will be retrieved from Glacier.</p>
<p>CloudCore assumes that in the worst-case scenario, that one of the production environments suffers a complete data loss, the account will be reconstructed from code, and the data restored from Glacier that is hosted within a different AWS account and geolocation.</p>
