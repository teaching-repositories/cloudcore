**Title:** Policy Document Numbering System  
**Doc#:** P-MGMT-002  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** April 21, 2024  

## Introduction

The Policy Document Numbering System is established to provide a structured and
consistent method for assigning document numbers to all policy documents within
CloudCore. This system ensures easy identification, categorization, and
retrieval of policy documents across various departments and facilitates
effective document management and compliance tracking.

## Policy Statements

1. **System Design:** The document numbering system shall be a hybrid model,
   incorporating both sequential numbering and category-specific prefixes to
   reflect the nature of the policy content.
2. **Abbreviation Usage:** Each policy document shall be assigned a unique
   abbreviation based on its primary category, as outlined in the "Category
   Abbreviations" table.
3. **Sequential Numbering:** Following the category prefix, a sequential
   numbering format will be used starting from 001 for each category, ensuring
   unique identifiers for each policy within a category.
4. **Version Control:** All policy documents must include a version number and
   revision date in their headers to track amendments and updates effectively.

## Controls and Procedures

1. **Assigning Document Numbers:**
   - Upon creation, each policy document is to be assigned a document number by
     the Document Control Officer. The number will consist of a category
     abbreviation followed by a sequential number, formatted as `ABB-XXX`, where
     `ABB` represents the abbreviation and `XXX` is the sequential number.
   - Example: The first policy document in the Data Protection category will be
     numbered as `POL-DATA-001`.

2. **Category Abbreviations:**
   - A standardised set of abbreviations for each policy category is maintained
     and updated by the Document Control Officer. This list is publicly
     accessible to all departments for reference.

    | Abbreviation | Category Description                               |
    |--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
    | COMP         | Compliance related policies                        |

    | DEV          | Development, including secure software development |
    | COMPL        | Specific compliance standards like HIPAA           |

3. **Document Abbreviations:**
   - A standarised set of abbreviations for each document type is maintained and
     updated by the Document Control Officer.  This list is publicly accessible
     to all department for reference.

    | Abbreviation | Type Description                                   |
    |--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
    | POL          | Prefix for Policies                                |
    | SOP          | Prefix for Standard Operating Procedures           |
    | DOC          | Prefix for other documents                         |


4. **Document Updates and Version Control:**
   - Any updates to a policy document require an update to both the version
     number and the document date. These changes must be recorded in the policy
     document log maintained by the Document Control Officer.
   - Revisions must reflect changes in the policy content or scope, and each
     version must be archived for future reference.

5. **Compliance and Monitoring:**
   - The compliance of the numbering system is regularly audited to ensure
     adherence to internal standards and effectiveness in policy management.
   - Non-compliance or inconsistencies in the document numbering must be
     addressed immediately to prevent documentation errors.
