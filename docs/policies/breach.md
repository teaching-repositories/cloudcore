title: "Breach Investigation and Notification"
categories: ["Incident Response", "Privacy", "Regulatory Compliance"]
---

To provide guidance for breach notification when impressive or unauthorised
access, acquisition, use and/or disclosure of the ePHI occurs.  In the case of a
breach, CloudCore shall notify all affected Customers. It is the responsibility
of the Customers to notify affected individuals.

## Policy Statements

CloudCore policy requires that:

(a) Breach notification procedures are invoked upon confirmation of security
breach that results in unauthorised disclosure of unprotected/unencrypted
sensitive data.

(b) Individuals impacted by a confirmed data breach must be notified within 60
days of discovery of such breach.

(c) In the event of a data breach that involves unencrypted ePHI,
CloudCore must report the breach to individuals impacted following
the HIPAA Breach Notification requirements (45 CFR Part 164, Subpart D).

## Controls and Procedures

### Breach Investigation Process

1. Discovery of Breach: A data breach shall be treated as "discovered" as of the
   first day on which such breach is known to the organisation, or, by
   exercising reasonable diligence would have been known to CloudCore (includes
   breaches by the organisation's Customers, Partners, or subcontractors).
   CloudCore shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is
   known or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any
   person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce
   member or Partner of the organisation. Following the discovery of a potential
   breach, the organisation shall begin an investigation (see organisational
   policies for security incident response and/or risk management incident
   response) immediately, conduct a risk assessment, and based on the results of
   the risk assessment, begin the process to notify each Customer affected by
   the breach. CloudCore shall also begin the process of determining what
   external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of
   Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement
   officials, etc.)

1. Breach Investigation: The CloudCore Security Officer shall name an individual
   to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security
   officer, risk manager, etc.). The investigator shall be responsible for the
   management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and
   coordinating with others in the organisation as appropriate (e.g.,
   administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk
   management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be
   the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate
   entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.). All
   documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk
   assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of seven years. A breach log is
   kept and maintained by the Security and Privacy Officer.

1. Risk Assessment: A risk assessment is performed in accordance to applicable
   laws and regulations.

   For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to
   constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy
   Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise
   permissible use or disclosure and occurs despite reasonable safeguards and
   proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy
   Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an
   impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires
   further notification, the organisation will need to perform a risk assessment
   to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a
   result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organisation shall
   document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident
   report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The
   organisation has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications
   to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a
   breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organisation will
   determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk
   assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and
   address:

    * Consideration of who impermissibility used or to whom the information was
      impermissibility disclosed;
    * The type and amount of ePHI involved;
    * The cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either
      Customer, CloudCore, or Partner.
    * The potential for significant risk of financial, reputation, or other
      harm.

1. Timeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made
   to the affected CloudCore Customers, usually within 24-48 hours but no later
   than 10 calendar days after the discovery of the breach. It is the
   responsibility of the organisation to demonstrate that all notifications were
   made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of delay.

1. Delay of Notification Authorised for Law Enforcement Purposes:  If a law
   enforcement official states to the organisation that a notification, notice,
   or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national
   security, the organisation shall:

    * If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is
      required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the timer period
      specified by the official; or
    * If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the
      identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification,
      notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of
      the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is
      submitted during that time.

1. Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must
   contain the following information:

    * A brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and
      the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;
    * A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that
      were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security
      number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability
      code or other types of information were involved), if known;
    * Any steps the Customer should take to protect Customer data from potential
      harm resulting from the breach.
    * A brief description of what CloudCore is doing to investigate
      the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Customers, and to protect
      against further breaches.
    * Contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional
      information, which may include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail
      address, a web site, or postal address.

1. Methods of Notification: CloudCore Customers will be notified via email and
   phone within the time frame for reporting breaches, as outlined above.

1. Maintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to
   the reports created for each incident, CloudCore shall maintain a process to
   record or log all breaches of unsecured sensitive data regardless of the
   number of records and Customers affected. The following information should be
   collected/logged for each breach (see sample Breach Notification Log):

    * A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date
      of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers
      affected, if known.
    * A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that
      were involved in the breach (such as full name, Social Security number,
      date of birth, home address, account number, etc.), if known.
    * A description of the action taken with regard to notification of patients
      regarding the breach.
    * Resolution steps taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future
      occurrences.

1. Workforce Training: CloudCore shall train all members of its workforce on the
   policies and procedures with respect to sensitive data as necessary and
   appropriate for the members to carry out their job responsibilities.
   Workforce members shall also be trained as to how to identify and report
   breaches within the organisation.

1. Complaints: CloudCore must provide a process for individuals to make
   complaints concerning the organisation's patient privacy policies and
   procedures or its compliance with such policies and procedures.

1. Sanctions: The organisation shall have in place and apply appropriate
   sanctions against members of its workforce, Customers, and Partners who fail
   to comply with privacy policies and procedures.

1. Retaliation/Waiver: CloudCore may not intimidate, threaten, coerce,
   discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual
   for the exercise by the individual of any privacy right. The organisation may
   not require individuals to waive their privacy rights under as a condition of
   the provision of treatment, payment, enrolment in a health plan, or
   eligibility for benefits.
