# What is Cloud Management?

Cloud management is the organized management of cloud computing products and services that operate in the cloud. It refers to the processes, strategies, policies, and technology used to help control and maintain public and private cloud, hybrid cloud, or multicloud environments. 

Today, you are likely operating partially or entirely in the cloud. As such, your organization needs a way to evaluate, monitor, and manage cloud computing resources, infrastructure, and services in the most efficient way possible. 

Keeping your cloud environments running smoothly requires many underlying tasks, from provisioning and orchestration of resources to automating cloud consumption and deployment, to lifecycle management of resources, cost optimization, performance monitoring, and security. 


# Cloud Management Platforms

Cloud management platforms are integrated products that provide for the management of public, private and hybrid cloud environments. The minimum requirements to be included in this category are products that incorporate self-service interfaces, provision system images, enable metering and billing, and provide for some degree of workload optimization through established policies. More-advanced offerings may also integrate with external enterprise management systems, include service catalogs, support the configuration of storage and network resources, allow for enhanced resource management via service governors and provide advanced monitoring for improved “guest” performance and availability.
