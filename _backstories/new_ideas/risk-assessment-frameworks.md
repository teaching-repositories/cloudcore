Here's a simplified overview of risk assessment frameworks based on ISO 27005 and NIST SP 800-30, along with templates that guide students through the process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks. These frameworks are designed to help students understand the structured approach to risk assessment and apply it in practical scenarios, such as evaluating the risks associated with the CloudCore Networks data breach.

### **Simplified Risk Assessment Frameworks**

### **1. ISO 27005-Based Risk Assessment Framework**

ISO 27005 is an international standard specifically focused on information security risk management. It provides guidelines for identifying, assessing, and managing risks in an information security context.

#### **Framework Overview:**

1. **Context Establishment:**
   - Define the scope of the risk assessment (e.g., specific systems, data types).
   - Identify the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls related to the scope.
   - Determine the risk criteria, including risk appetite and tolerance levels.

2. **Risk Identification:**
   - Identify potential threats to the assets (e.g., cyber-attacks, insider threats).
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by these threats.
   - Determine the existing controls that mitigate these vulnerabilities.

3. **Risk Analysis:**
   - Assess the likelihood of each threat exploiting a vulnerability.
   - Determine the potential impact on the organization if the threat is realized.
   - Combine likelihood and impact to calculate the risk level (e.g., low, medium, high).

4. **Risk Evaluation:**
   - Compare the calculated risk levels against the risk criteria to determine which risks are acceptable and which require treatment.
   - Prioritize risks based on their levels to focus on the most critical ones.

5. **Risk Treatment:**
   - Identify options for mitigating, transferring, accepting, or avoiding risks.
   - Select and implement appropriate risk treatment measures (e.g., additional controls, policy changes).

6. **Risk Monitoring and Review:**
   - Continuously monitor the risk environment and the effectiveness of the risk treatment measures.
   - Review and update the risk assessment regularly or when significant changes occur.

#### **ISO 27005 Risk Assessment Template:**

| **Risk ID** | **Asset**        | **Threat**                | **Vulnerability**           | **Existing Controls**       | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Risk Level** | **Treatment Option**     | **Responsible** | **Status** |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|------------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| R-001       | Customer Data    | Phishing Attack           | Weak MFA enforcement        | Basic MFA, Phishing training | High           | High       | High           | Strengthen MFA, Enhance Training | CISO            | In Progress |
| R-002       | Network Access   | Misconfiguration          | Inadequate firewall rules   | Manual reviews               | Medium         | High       | Medium         | Automate configuration reviews | IT Manager       | Planned    |
| R-003       | Financial Records | Data Exfiltration        | Lack of DLP controls        | Basic monitoring             | High           | Very High  | Critical       | Implement advanced DLP      | Security Team    | Not Started|

### **2. NIST SP 800-30-Based Risk Assessment Framework**

NIST SP 800-30 provides a comprehensive guide for conducting risk assessments, emphasizing a risk management approach that identifies, assesses, and prioritizes risks to organizational operations, assets, and individuals.

#### **Framework Overview:**

1. **Prepare for Assessment:**
   - Establish the context, including the scope, objectives, and stakeholders involved in the risk assessment.
   - Gather information on the systems, processes, and environment to be assessed.

2. **Conduct Risk Assessment:**
   - **Risk Identification:** Identify sources of risk, including threat actors, threat events, vulnerabilities, and impacted assets.
   - **Risk Analysis:** Determine the likelihood and impact of threat events exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Risk Determination:** Calculate the risk by considering the combined likelihood and impact, often using qualitative or quantitative scales.

3. **Communicate and Share Assessment Results:**
   - Document the findings, including identified risks, their levels, and recommended actions.
   - Communicate results to stakeholders in a clear and actionable manner.

4. **Maintain Assessment:**
   - Regularly review and update the risk assessment to reflect changes in the threat landscape, vulnerabilities, or organizational priorities.

#### **NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment Template:**

| **Risk ID** | **System/Process** | **Threat Source** | **Threat Event**           | **Vulnerability**           | **Impact**  | **Likelihood** | **Risk Score** | **Risk Response**       | **Action Plan**             | **Owner**     |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| NIST-001    | Customer Database  | External Actors   | Phishing for Credentials   | Weak Phishing Awareness     | High        | Likely         | High           | Mitigate                | Improve training, Enhance MFA | Security Team |
| NIST-002    | Internal Network   | Internal Threats  | Misuse of Privileged Access | Excessive Privilege         | Medium      | Possible       | Medium         | Mitigate                | Conduct access reviews       | IT Manager    |
| NIST-003    | Financial Systems  | External Hackers  | Ransomware Attack          | Inadequate Endpoint Protection | Very High | Unlikely       | High           | Transfer (Insurance)    | Improve endpoint security    | CISO          |

### **Guiding Students Through Risk Assessment:**

**Step 1: Identify Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**
- Students should start by listing all critical assets (e.g., customer data, network systems) and identifying potential threats (e.g., phishing, insider misuse). They should then identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by these threats.

**Step 2: Analyze Risks**
- Students should assess the likelihood of each threat exploiting a vulnerability and the potential impact on the organization if the threat is realized. This can be done using a simple scale (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

**Step 3: Evaluate and Prioritize Risks**
- Students should compare the assessed risks against the organizationâ€™s risk criteria to determine which risks are acceptable and which need treatment. Prioritization should be based on risk levels, focusing on high and critical risks.

**Step 4: Determine Risk Treatments**
- For each identified risk, students should decide on a treatment option: Mitigate (reduce the risk), Transfer (shift the risk, e.g., insurance), Accept (acknowledge the risk), or Avoid (eliminate the risk source).

**Step 5: Develop Action Plans**
- Students should outline specific action plans for the chosen risk treatments, including what actions will be taken, who is responsible, and the status of these actions.

These simplified frameworks and templates provide students with a practical, structured approach to risk assessment, helping them apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios like the CloudCore Networks data breach.
