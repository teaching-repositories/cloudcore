### **Analysis Tasks for Students:**
1. **Assess the Impact:** Evaluate the types of data exposed in the breach and consider the potential consequences for affected customers, such as identity theft or financial fraud.
   
2. **Identify Sensitive Data:** Highlight which data fields are particularly sensitive and why they pose a risk if exposed (e.g., PII, payment details).

3. **Determine Regulatory Implications:** Consider the compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and discuss how the exposure of this data could lead to legal consequences for CloudCore Networks.

4. **Develop Mitigation Strategies:** Suggest how CloudCore could better protect this type of data in the future through encryption, access control, and data minimization strategies.

5. **Risk Evaluation:** Rank the data fields in terms of risk priority and propose steps to mitigate the exposure of high-risk data.

These sample data sets provide students with tangible examples of the type of information involved in the breach, enabling them to practice data impact assessments and develop relevant security measures.
