### **CloudCore Networks Security Policy Documents**

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024  
**Version:** 2.5  
**Prepared By:** Security and Compliance Department

---

### **1. Password Policy**

**Purpose:**
The Password Policy aims to establish a standard for creating, maintaining, and protecting passwords used to access CloudCore Networks’ systems and data, ensuring that passwords are strong, unique, and secure to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

**Scope:**
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who access CloudCore Networks’ systems, applications, or data.

**Policy Statements:**
1. **Password Creation:**
   - Passwords must be at least 8 characters long and include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Passwords should not contain any part of the user’s name, username, or easily guessable words.
   - Passwords must be unique and not reused across different systems or applications.

2. **Password Management:**
   - Passwords must be changed every 90 days. Users will receive notifications to update their passwords two weeks before the expiration date.
   - Users are required to use a password manager approved by CloudCore for storing and managing their passwords securely.
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enabled for access to all critical systems, with exceptions made for certain administrative roles.

3. **Password Protection:**
   - Users must not share their passwords with anyone, including colleagues, managers, or IT personnel.
   - Passwords should not be written down or stored in plain text files, emails, or unsecured documents.
   - Any suspected or known compromise of a password must be reported immediately to the Security Operations Center (SOC).

4. **Account Lockout:**
   - Accounts will be locked after five failed login attempts. Locked accounts can be unlocked after a 15-minute cooldown period or by contacting the IT helpdesk.
   - Account lockout and reset procedures will be regularly tested to ensure they are functioning as intended.

5. **Password Reset:**
   - Users who forget their passwords must use the self-service password reset tool, which requires answering security questions or verifying their identity via email or SMS.
   - Password reset links will expire within 30 minutes and can only be used once.

**Enforcement:**
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including restricted access to systems, mandatory retraining, or other actions deemed appropriate by management.

**Review and Updates:**
This policy will be reviewed annually or as needed to reflect changes in security requirements or best practices.

### **2. Incident Response Plan**

**Purpose:**
The Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines the processes and responsibilities for identifying, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. The goal is to minimize the impact of incidents on CloudCore Networks and its customers by ensuring a prompt and effective response.

**Scope:**
The IRP applies to all incidents that affect the security, confidentiality, integrity, or availability of CloudCore Networks’ systems, data, or services.

**Incident Categories:**
- **Category 1: Minor Incidents** – Incidents that do not significantly affect operations or security, such as isolated malware detections.
- **Category 2: Moderate Incidents** – Incidents that involve unauthorized access or data breaches with limited impact.
- **Category 3: Major Incidents** – Incidents that significantly impact operations, such as widespread ransomware attacks, major data breaches, or severe system outages.

**Incident Response Phases:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Establish an Incident Response Team (IRT) composed of members from IT, Security, Legal, Compliance, and Communications departments.
   - Maintain an updated contact list of IRT members and external partners, such as cybersecurity consultants and legal advisors.
   - Ensure all employees are trained on incident reporting procedures and their role in incident response.

2. **Identification:**
   - Monitor systems and networks continuously for signs of incidents using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools and other monitoring solutions.
   - Use predefined criteria to assess and classify potential incidents based on severity and impact.
   - Document all detected incidents in the Incident Management System (IMS) for tracking and analysis.

3. **Containment:**
   - Implement immediate containment measures to limit the spread of the incident, such as isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, or blocking malicious traffic.
   - For moderate and major incidents, initiate short-term containment actions followed by longer-term solutions to prevent recurrence.

4. **Eradication:**
   - Identify the root cause of the incident and remove any malicious components, such as malware or unauthorized access points.
   - Patch vulnerabilities, update security configurations, and implement additional security measures as needed.

5. **Recovery:**
   - Restore affected systems, data, and services to normal operation, ensuring that systems are clean and secure before going back online.
   - Conduct thorough testing to verify the effectiveness of the recovery process and ensure that the incident has been fully resolved.

6. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Conduct a post-incident review within 10 days of incident resolution to analyze the response, identify areas for improvement, and update the IRP as needed.
   - Share findings with relevant stakeholders and incorporate lessons learned into training and awareness programs.

**Communication:**
- Internal communications should keep all relevant teams informed of the incident status and response actions.
- For major incidents, external communications, including breach notifications to customers or regulatory bodies, must be coordinated with the Communications and Legal teams.

**Reporting:**
- All incidents, regardless of severity, must be reported to the SOC. Major incidents must also be reported to senior management and the Board of Directors within 24 hours.
- Regulatory and legal reporting requirements must be followed, including timely notifications to affected individuals and authorities as required by law.

**Review and Updates:**
The Incident Response Plan will be reviewed semi-annually or following any major incident to ensure it remains effective and up to date.

### **Recommendations for Students:**
**1. Critique the Policies:**
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the password policy and incident response plan. Identify any gaps or areas that could be improved, such as the complexity of password requirements, MFA enforcement, or the speed and effectiveness of incident containment measures.
  
**2. Develop Improvements:**
- Suggest enhancements, such as increasing the minimum password length, implementing continuous monitoring of password reuse across platforms, or adding automation tools to streamline incident detection and response processes.

**3. Connect to Real-World Scenarios:**
- Relate the policies to recent incidents outlined in the threat intelligence feeds. For example, consider how improvements to the incident response plan could mitigate the impact of a ransomware attack or insider threat.

**4. Compliance Alignment:**
- Discuss how these policies align with relevant regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, and identify any necessary adjustments to meet compliance standards.

These policy documents offer a basis for critical analysis, allowing students to explore practical ways to enhance CloudCore Networks' security posture and better protect against evolving cybersecurity threats.
