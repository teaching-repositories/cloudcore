    "section": "",
    "text": "Interviewer: Raj, thank you for joining us today. Could you start by describing your role at CloudCore Networks and your main responsibilities?\nRaj Patel (IT Manager): Sure, I’m the IT Manager here at CloudCore, which means I’m responsible for overseeing our entire IT infrastructure. This includes managing our network, servers, and cloud environments, as well as ensuring that our systems run smoothly and securely. My role involves coordinating with various teams, including security, to implement technology solutions that support our business goals.\nInterviewer: Given your role, how did you experience the recent data breach? What were your initial thoughts when it was discovered?\nRaj Patel: When the breach was first discovered, it was a wake-up call for all of us. The initial alert came from our automated monitoring systems, which flagged unusual database activity. My first thought was to identify the scope of the breach and work with the Security Operations Center to isolate the affected systems. It was clear early on that a compromised credential was involved, and our priority was to cut off the attacker’s access as quickly as possible.\nInterviewer: What do you think were the primary technical weaknesses that allowed the breach to occur?\nRaj Patel: Technically speaking, the breach exploited a couple of key weaknesses. One was a misconfiguration in our firewall that inadvertently allowed broader access than intended, creating an entry point for the attacker. Additionally, our multi-factor authentication setup was inconsistently applied across administrative accounts, which allowed the attacker to bypass this critical security layer once they had the credentials. Finally, while we do have robust monitoring, the system failed to prioritise the alert effectively, delaying our response.\nInterviewer: Since the breach, what steps have you taken to improve CloudCore’s IT security measures?\nRaj Patel: We’ve made several immediate changes. First, we reviewed and tightened all firewall rules and configurations to close any gaps that could be exploited. We’ve also expanded our MFA requirements to include all accounts without exception, ensuring that even if credentials are compromised, additional barriers exist. On the monitoring side, we’re refining our alert prioritisation to ensure that high-risk activities get immediate attention. We’ve also implemented stricter access controls and are conducting a comprehensive review of all administrative privileges.\nInterviewer: From your perspective, what are the key challenges that CloudCore faces in maintaining a secure IT environment?\nRaj Patel: One of the biggest challenges is keeping pace with the evolving threat landscape. Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, and attackers are always looking for new ways to exploit vulnerabilities. Another challenge is balancing security with operational efficiency. For example, while tightening access controls is crucial, it can also slow down workflows if not managed properly. We need to find the right balance between robust security measures and maintaining a seamless user experience.\nInterviewer: What are your long-term goals for CloudCore’s IT security? How do you plan to achieve them?\nRaj Patel: Long-term, my goal is to build a resilient IT infrastructure that can withstand a wide range of cyber threats. This includes investing in more advanced security technologies, such as AI-driven anomaly detection and automated response systems. I also want to focus on building stronger partnerships across departments. Security isn’t just the responsibility of the security team; it’s a shared responsibility across IT, operations, and even our end-users. To achieve this, I’m advocating for more integrated security processes and continuous training to keep everyone engaged and aware of their role in protecting our systems.\nInterviewer: Thanks for your time, Raj. Any final thoughts on how CloudCore can better prepare for future challenges?\nRaj Patel: My final thought is that we need to stay proactive rather than reactive. Continuous improvement should be our mantra—whether it’s updating our technology, revisiting our policies, or educating our team, there’s always room to do better. By staying ahead of potential threats and fostering a culture of security awareness, I’m confident we can navigate through any challenges that come our way.\nInterviewer: Thanks again, Raj. Your insights are really helpful.\nRaj Patel: You’re welcome. It’s all about teamwork and staying ahead of the curve."

Could you walk me through your configuration hardening standards?\nSysAdmin: Sure, we utilise industry standard benchmarks like CIS and NIST to lock down settings for OS, firewalls, databases and more according to best practices. We keep gold images to simplify patching and deployment.\nAuditor: Excellent. And how do you ensure consistency and compliance with those standards?\nSysAdmin: Our configuration management system scans new systems against the gold benchmark to validate before production. We also run monthly audits to identify any drift or issues.\nAuditor: Great to hear. I’m here to understand how your systems are secured in an open discussion. If any gaps arise, I’ll work with you on practical recommendations. Does that sound agreeable?\nSysAdmin: Absolutely, I look forward to the constructive feedback on where we can improve. We take a continuous learning approach to security and compliance here.\nAuditor: Glad we’re on the same page. Could you tell me about how you perform patch management and keep systems up-to-date?\nSysAdmin: Of course. We classify patches by criticality. Critical and security updates are applied on a 2 week cycle to production after testing…\nAuditor: What tools and capabilities do you utilise for monitoring and logging system activity?\nSysAdmin: We deploy Sysmon for endpoint logging and have a SIEM collecting logs centrally. Critical systems utilise process monitoring to detect malicious changes.\nAuditor: Could you outline the key controls you have in place to secure privileged access to systems?\nSysAdmin: Minimising standing privilege access, enforcing MFA for admin accounts, using privilged access management tools for just-in-time elevation. Logs are closely monitored.\nAuditor: What is your approach to infrastructure automation and configuration management?\nSysAdmin: We utilise Ansible and Terraform to automate deployment, configuration, and management based on code.

    "text": "Interviewer: Thank you for speaking with us, Sophia. Can you start by telling us a bit about your role at CloudCore Networks and your vision for the company’s security posture?\nSophia Martinez (CISO): Absolutely. As the Chief Information Security Officer at CloudCore Networks, my primary responsibility is to develop and implement our information security strategy. My vision is to create a security environment that not only protects our data but also enhances our ability to deliver secure and reliable services to our clients. I believe that security should be an enabler for business growth, not just a checkbox for compliance.\nInterviewer: That’s a great perspective. Given the recent data breach, how would you assess CloudCore’s current security posture? What were the main factors that contributed to the breach?\nSophia Martinez: Our security posture has strong foundations—we have robust network defenses, a dedicated security operations team, and compliance with major frameworks like ISO 27001. However, the breach highlighted several areas where we need to improve. The main factors contributing to the breach were inconsistent enforcement of multi-factor authentication, especially for senior-level administrative accounts, and a lapse in phishing awareness. The attacker exploited these weaknesses, gaining access through compromised credentials.\nInterviewer: How has the organisation responded since the breach? What immediate actions have you taken?\nSophia Martinez: Right after discovering the breach, our first step was to contain the incident by revoking compromised credentials and isolating affected systems. We’ve since expanded MFA enforcement to all administrative accounts without exception and have increased our investment in advanced threat detection technologies. We’ve also initiated a company-wide review of access permissions to ensure that the principle of least privilege is strictly applied. Importantly, we’re doubling down on our phishing awareness training to help employees better recognise and report suspicious activity.\nInterviewer: Looking forward, what changes do you envision for CloudCore’s security strategy to prevent future incidents?\nSophia Martinez: Moving forward, I’m focused on building a more adaptive security framework that can respond to evolving threats in real-time. This includes expanding our use of AI-driven threat detection, increasing automation in our incident response processes, and integrating security into every stage of our software development lifecycle. Additionally, I’m pushing for more cross-departmental collaboration because security isn’t just the responsibility of the security team—it’s everyone’s job. I believe that by fostering a security-first culture and continuing to invest in cutting-edge technologies, we can turn these challenges into strengths.\nInterviewer: That’s an inspiring approach. Any final thoughts on what you’d like your team or the company to focus on as we move past this breach?\nSophia Martinez: My key message to the team is that this breach is a learning opportunity. We need to stay vigilant, continuously improve our defences, and never become complacent. I also want us to keep our communication channels open—whether it’s reporting a suspicious email or discussing a potential vulnerability, every input counts. We’re in this together, and by working as a cohesive unit, we can not only recover but come out stronger.\nInterviewer: Thank you, Sophia. Your insights are invaluable.\nSophia Martinez: Thank you. It’s a team effort, and I’m confident we’ll navigate through this successfully."

    "text": "Title\nLegal and Comliance Insights\n\n\nDoc#\nDOC-DATA-024\n\n\nVersion\n1.0\n\n\nDate\n07-07-2024\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Relevant Regulatory Obligations\nAs a provider of cloud services to various industries, including finance, healthcare, and education, CloudCore Networks must comply with a range of regulatory standards designed to protect personal data and ensure information security. The recent data breach exposes the company to potential legal repercussions under these frameworks, emphasising the importance of maintaining compliance to avoid fines, penalties, and reputational damage.\n\n\n1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nOverview: - The GDPR is a comprehensive data protection law that applies to organisations handling the personal data of individuals within the European Union (EU). - Key principles include data minimisation, purpose limitation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality, and accountability.\nObligations: - Data Protection: Organisations must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or access. - Breach Notification: GDPR requires organisations to notify the relevant supervisory authority of a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. - Data Subject Rights: Individuals have the right to access their data, request corrections, and demand deletion (the right to be forgotten). Organisations must facilitate these rights promptly and transparently. - Penalties: Non-compliance can result in significant fines, up to €20 million or 4% of the organisation’s annual global turnover, whichever is higher.\nRelevance to CloudCore: - As a cloud service provider, CloudCore must ensure that all customer data, including that of EU residents, is handled in compliance with GDPR requirements, particularly concerning data protection and breach notification protocols.\n\n\n2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nOverview: - HIPAA is a U.S. law that establishes national standards for the protection of individuals’ medical records and other personal health information (PHI). - It applies to healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates, including cloud service providers that handle PHI.\nObligations: - Security Rule: Organisations must implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. - Breach Notification Rule: HIPAA mandates that covered entities notify affected individuals, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), and, in some cases, the media, of a breach of unsecured PHI. - Business Associate Agreements (BAAs): CloudCore, as a business associate, must have a BAA with covered entities, outlining its responsibilities for safeguarding PHI and compliance with HIPAA.\nPenalties: - Penalties for non-compliance can range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a maximum annual penalty of $1.5 million for repeated violations. Criminal charges may apply in cases of willful neglect.\nRelevance to CloudCore: - CloudCore must ensure strict compliance with HIPAA when providing services to healthcare clients, including implementing robust security controls and maintaining breach response protocols.\n\n\n3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)\nOverview: - PCI DSS is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. - The standard applies to merchants and service providers, including cloud service providers that handle payment information.\nObligations: - Data Protection: PCI DSS requires the encryption of cardholder data, secure network configurations, strong access control measures, regular monitoring, and security testing. - Incident Response: Organisations must have an incident response plan in place to address data breaches involving payment information. - Compliance Validation: Organisations are required to perform regular compliance assessments, which may include self-assessment questionnaires or third-party audits.\nPenalties: - Non-compliance can result in fines from credit card companies, increased transaction fees, and potential revocation of the right to process payment cards.\nRelevance to CloudCore: - CloudCore must comply with PCI DSS requirements when handling payment data for its clients, ensuring that encryption and security monitoring are in place to protect cardholder information.\n\n\n4. Industry-Specific Standards and Best Practices\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework: - Although not legally binding, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides guidelines, best practices, and standards for managing cybersecurity risks. - CloudCore can use the NIST framework as a foundation for strengthening its cybersecurity posture, including risk assessments, continuous monitoring, and incident response planning.\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): - Similar to GDPR, CCPA provides California residents with rights related to the access, deletion, and sharing of their personal information. - Obligations include providing privacy notices, honouring opt-out requests, and ensuring that personal data is not sold without consent.\nRelevance to CloudCore: - While CloudCore may not be directly subject to all industry-specific regulations, aligning with best practices from NIST and preparing for compliance with state laws like CCPA enhances its overall security posture and readiness.\n\n\nSummary of Legal Implications for CloudCore Networks\nThe recent data breach at CloudCore Networks raises significant concerns under various regulatory frameworks, particularly GDPR and HIPAA, due to the exposure of personal and sensitive information. Immediate actions are required to mitigate potential legal repercussions, including:\n\nStrengthening Data Protection Measures: Enhance encryption, access controls, and monitoring to safeguard personal data and comply with regulatory standards.\nEnsuring Prompt Breach Notifications: Develop and test robust breach notification protocols to ensure timely communication with regulatory authorities, customers, and affected parties.\nConducting Compliance Audits: Regularly review and audit compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and other relevant standards to identify gaps and implement corrective actions.\nTraining and Awareness: Expand training programs for employees to increase awareness of data protection obligations and the importance of compliance with applicable laws.\n\nCloudCore Networks must prioritise compliance with these regulatory obligations to avoid significant fines, legal challenges, and damage to its reputation. By addressing identified vulnerabilities and aligning with best practices, CloudCore can enhance its resilience against future breaches and build trust with its clients."

It remedies the deficiencies with perimeter-centric strategies and the legacy devices and technologies used to implement them. It does this by promoting “never trust, always verify” as its guiding principle. This differs substantially from conventional security models which operate on the basis of “trust but verify.”\nIn particular, with Zero Trust there is no default trust for any entity — including users, devices, applications, and packets—regardless of what it is and its location on or relative to the corporate network. In addition, verifying that authorised entities are always doing only what they’re allowed to do is no longer optional; it’s now mandatory.\n!!! Summary\n* No internal network. (Almost) 100% cloud.\n* Fully segregated with Granular policy enforcements.\n* Individually secured devices. No production access by default.\n\n\n(2) “Air-Gapped” environments meet short-lived processes\nWe extend the zero-trust security model with a “Minimal Infrastructure” approach, where we use “Anything-as-a-Service” whenever possible, to harness the full power of the cloud. Cloud services allow us to contain and control access at a much more granular level, compared to operating on-premise infrastructure. Via access to the extensive APIs provided by the cloud services, we would be able to more easily integrate and automate security operations. Additionally, minimising infrastructure significantly reduces always-on attack surfaces. Services that are not used are turned off, instead of being idly available which opens itself up to attacks. Together with Zero Trust, this security model and architecture enables a high degree of flexibility for end-user computing while maintaining the highest level of security assurance.\n!!! Summary\n* No direct administrative or broad network connectivity into production.\n* Processes are short-lived and killed after use.\n* Minimal persistent attack surface making it virtually impenetrable.\n\n\n(3) Least-privilege temporary access\nCyber attacks are inevitable. When it comes to preparing for potential attacks, CloudCore security operations take the approach that assumes a compromise can happen at any time, to any device, with little to no indicators. This is also an extension of the “zero trust” model. When building security operations, we carefully perform risk analysis and threat model, to identify potential single point of compromise and to avoid having the “keys to the kingdom”.\nIn other words, compromise of any single system or user or credential, should not easily lead to a broad or full compromise of the entire infrastructure or operations. For example, if an attacker gains access to a admin credential (e.g. Active Directory domain), it should not directly lead to the compromise of all systems and data in the environment.\n!!! Summary\n* Need-based access control for both employees and computing services.\n* Access to critical systems and resources are closed by default, granted on demand.\n* Protected by strong multi-factor authentication.\n* No “keys to the kingdom”; no single points of compromise.\n* \"Secrets\" (such as SSH Keys) must remain secret at all times.\n\n\n(4) Immutable builds and deploys\nThe CloudCore platform leverages a micro-service architecture. This means that the system has been decomposed into numerous small components that can be built and deployed individually. Before these components get deployed to our production environments, we thoroughly test and validate the changes in our lower environments which are completely isolated from production. This allows us to test upcoming changes while ensuring there is no impact to our customers.\nAs a particular build of a component progresses through our environments, it is important that the build does not change thus we ensure that each build is immutable. Once an immutable build has been validated in our lower (non-production) environments, we then deploy it to our production environment where the change will be available to CloudCore customers and end-users.\nChanges to our infrastructure (database schema changes, storage buckets, load balances, DNS entries, etc.) are also described in our source code and deployed to our environments just like the applications. This architectural approach to managing infrastructure is referred to as infrastructure as code and is a key requirement for fully automated deployments with minimal human touch.\n!!! Summary\n* Infrastructure as code with active protection.\n* Automated security scans and full traceability from code commit to production.\n* “Hands-free” deployment ensures each build is free from human error or malicious contamination.\n\n\n(5) End-to-end data protection and privacy\nIt is of the utmost importance that CloudCore provides for confidentiality (privacy), integrity and availability of its customer’s data. Your data is protected with end-to-end encryption, combined with strong access control and key management. We also prohibit our internal employees to access customer data directly in production. So your data remains safe and private at all times. We will never use or share your data without your prior consent.\nWe are proud to offer our customers data storage peace of mind with a money-back guarantee. We guarantee your private data stored on our platform is always safe and protected from cyberattacks such as ransomware, and we will reimburse you for certain losses of such data due to unauthorised activity in eligible accounts that resulted through no fault of your own.\n!!! Summary\n* Data is safe both at rest and in transit, using strong encryption, access control and key management.\n* No internal user access is allowed to customer data in production.\n\n\n(6) Strong yet flexible user access\nWe all know by now that “Passw0rd” makes a terrible password. Access control is so important we must get it right. That’s why we leverage tried-and-true technology such as SAML, OAuth, multi-factor authentication, and fine-grained authorisation to provide strong yet intuitive access options, both for our internal staff to access business resources and for our customers to access CloudCore platform and services.\n!!! Summary\n* OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML for customer authentication and single sign-on.\n* Multi-factor authentication.\n* Fine-grain attribute-based or role-based authorisation.\n\n\n(7) Watch everything, even the watchers\nYou can’t protect what you can’t see.\nAs the famous strategist, Sun Tsu, once said, “Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.” It all starts with knowing ourselves. This applies to the infrastructure, environments, operations, users, systems, resources, and most importantly, data. It is important to inventory all assets, document all operations, identify all weaknesses, and visualise/understand all events.\nThis includes conducting various risk analysis, threat modeling, vulnerability assessments, application scanning, and penetration testing. Not only that, this requires security operations to keep an eye on everything, and someone should also “watch the watchers”.\nAt first, this would require significant manual effort and may seem impossible to keep up-to-date. Our goal is to automate security operations, so that this can be achieved programmatically as our operations evolve to become more complex.\nAdditionally, CloudCore security team will actively monitor threat intelligence in the community, with feeds and information sharing platform such as NH-ISAC to stay abreast of the attacker activities and methodologies.\n!!! Summary\n* All environments are monitored; All events are logged; All alerts are analysed; All assets are tracked.\n* No privileged access without prior approval or full auditing.\n* We deploy monitoring redundancy to “watch the watchers”.\n\n\n(8) Centralised and automated operations\nAs much as possible, CloudCore security will translate policy and compliance requirements into reusable code for easy implementation and maintenance. This allows us to truly be able to enforce policy and compliance in a fast and scalable way, rather than relying solely on written policies and intermittent manual audits. For example, end-point device policies may be translated into Chef InSpec code and compliance may be enforced through the agent. Access Control policies for production environments are translated into AWS IAM JSON policies and implemented via Terraform code.\nAutomation makes it truly possible to centralise security operations, including not only event aggregation and correlation, but also the orchestration and management of previously siloed security controls and remediation efforts.\n!!! Summary\n* API-driven cloud-native security fabric that\n    - centrally monitors security events,\n    - visualises risk management,\n    - automates compliance audits, and\n    - orchestrates near real-time remediation.\n\n\n(9) Usable security\nSecurity benefits from transparency, and should operate as an open-book. This allows the entire organisation to take responsibility for and accountability of adopting security best practices. Similar to code reviews and pull requests in the development process, CloudCore security team makes security standards and practices available to all employees for feedback prior to adoption.\nWe emphasise on the usability and practicality of security. A security solution or process is not effective, if it is not being used, no matter how good it may be. Having impractical security would only generate noise, provide a false sense of security, and incur unnecessary cost. Nothing is perfect, but we embrace an agile mindset to test and try, and to continuously improve.\n!!! Summary\n* All employees receive security awareness training not annually, but monthly.\n* Simple policies, processes, and procedures.\n* No “Shadow IT”.\n* DevSecOps with common goals and an integrated team.\n* Processes that encourage self management and reward good behaviour.\n\n\n(10) Regulatory compliant and hacker verified\nSecurity != Compliance. We cannot have one without the other.\n!!! Summary\n* Regulatory Compliant;\n* Independently assessed and certified;\n* Hacker verified.\n\n\n\nSecurity Architecture\nCloudCore developed a security architecture on top of its three main infrastructure environments - Cloud (AWS), DevOps, and workforce collaboration / end-user computing.\n\nArchitecture Diagrams\nDetailed architecture diagrams of the in-scope networks, endpoints, applications as well as the security operations are developed and maintained by JupiterOne.\n\n\nCloud Architecture\n\nCloud Native\n\nDesigned for the cloud using true multi-tenant architecture\nAuto scaling across multiple data centers in multiple regions around the world\nCloudCore services deployed inside private subnets of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nComprehensive security and compliance via AWS certifications\nOngoing security testing by AWS and AWS customers\n\n\n\nCustomer Benefits\n\nInfrastructure is tailored to our customer’s goals and usage patterns\n“Shared use” model reduces cost\nNearly infinite compute and data capacity via AWS cloud provider\nCustomers can focus on solving business problems and not worry about infrastructure\nAutomatic backup and recovery\nContinuous improvements via change control process\nFaster adoption of new technology\n\n\n\nEvolution of Cloud Computing\n\nBaremetal\n\nA computer in someone else’s data center\n\nVirtual Machine\n\nA portion of a computer in someone else’s data center\nIn AWS, a Virtual Machine is created from Amason Machine Image (AMI)\n\nContainer\n\nA package of essential application libraries and code but not the core OS libraries - Simpler to scale a docker image because - No duplication of core OS processes (networking, filesystem, etc) - Typically a Docker container\n\nFunction\n\nJust the application code that runs in a pre-built container\n\n\nCloudCore strives to leverage functions as the primary building blocks for our platform because:\n\nfunctions deploy more quickly than containers and virtual machines\nAWS automatically scales Lambda functions based on the number of incoming invocations\nthey are short-lived processes which minimises attack surface\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrics, Measurements and Continuous Monitoring\nA set of metrics / KPIs have been defined to assist in the measuring, reporting and optimising the security program and the controls in place.\nA security scorecard is produced every with updates to key metrics of the CloudCore information security program, to measure its adoption and effectiveness.\nThe reports and scorecards are maintained by and can be accessed at JupiterOne.\n\n\nQuality of Service\nCloudCore strives to provide a high quality of service to all of its customers. This is accomplished through a security architecture that encompasses all of CloudCore’s operations and provides high data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nAn overview of CloudCore’s architecture can be found in Security Architecture. CloudCore uses a highly scalable cloud architecture to provide system quality at all times.\nAll systems are monitored and measured in real time as described in Application Service Event Recovery.\nCloudCore uses DevOps methodology as described in Software Development Process to ensure a smooth delivery process of all systems and applications.\nStatus for external facing, customer applications and systems is published at ."

The language may be changed to more accurately reflect business arrangements between a covered entity and business associate or business associate and subcontractor. In addition, these or similar provisions may be incorporated into an agreement for the provision of services between a covered entity and business associate or business associate and subcontractor, or they may be incorporated into a separate business associate agreement. These provisions address only concepts and requirements set forth in the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Enforcement Rules, and alone may not be sufficient to result in a binding contract under State law. They do not include many formalities and substantive provisions that may be required or typically included in a valid contract.

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nSoftware Development Process\n\nOverview\nSoftware development at CloudCore follows a release strategy that provides traceability for production software changes. Features, enhancements, and bugs are written up as Issues in . An engineer on a small team proposes changes necessary and creates a review for the team (). Continuous integration () kicks off unit and functional tests which pass before changes are merged into the repository. Once the review is complete, the changes are now deployed to the development environment where regression and end-to-end tests are run before the new code replaces the existing in-service code (test then deploy model). Small teams can decide to follow a source-control branching strategy that makes sense: git-flow, github flow.\nCloudCore practices continuous delivery of code into production through multiple environments: development, testing, production. The deploy process and infrastructure roll-out are written as code (using technologies such as Terraform and AWS Cloudformation) and managed under source control.\nCloudCore’s multiple lower environments (dev, test) provide an ecosystem of sample data sets that exercise the application and services when test automation is run. The test environment is where the system is stressed for performance and scalability. Performance and scalability changes are driven by metric data captured through monitoring and logging (metrics before and after change – typically captured as part of the issue description/writeup).\nDeployments to production are gated by change control process where an issue is opened which identify what is new/changed (). Sign-offs are recorded by development, testing, security, and product management. Production roll-outs happen on a regular basis without impact to service. This continuous process allows for security updates to roll out regularly and with urgency. If there is impact to production, a rollback is performed to restore service and whatever caused the problem is reverted from source. This restarts the re-proposal approval process of source changes. This process keeps the set of differences between the development environment and the production environment as low as possible.\nIn the continuous delivery mindset, features are not released by the deployment of code into production, instead features are enabled in production at the appropriate time (dark launching). Feature toggle enablement in production is gated by a change control ticket () that follows the software roll-out approval process. Feature toggle enablement in production can have a few more dependencies than code. Those dependencies include things like external documentation, early access programs, and internal playbooks for supporting the feature.\n\n\nSecure Development Standards\nTraceability of code changes allow for our software to be a living entity. Our current system for documenting changes is . Every commit and/or Pull-Request, should have a supplied that describes contextually why this change is necessary and reasonable. These artifacts over time allow for one to trace the lineage of why our production software and services change over time.\nAll CloudCore git repositories have a company standard configuration from a perspective. This standard is a guideline and can be relaxed, but socialise when those exceptions are needed. One example of an exception, is the wiki repository, as editing a wiki and always requiring a PR in this setting slows down ‘flow’.\n\nCode: &lt;#&gt;\nRepo settings: &lt;#&gt;\nBuild: &lt;#&gt;\n\nNOTE: The Sandbox project (and repos) do not follow this standard. And certain projects might be excluded (e.g. wiki).\nDevelopers follow the branch strategy and code review process below:\n\nAll development uses feature branches based on the main branch used for the current release. Any changes required for a new feature or defect fix are committed to that feature branch.\n\nThese changes must be covered under 1) a unit test where possible, or 2) integration tests.\nIntegration tests are required if unit tests cannot reliably exercise all facets of the change.\n\nDevelopers are strongly encouraged to follow the commit message conventions suggested by GitHub.\n\nCommit messages should be wrapped to 72 characters.\nCommit messages should be written in the present tense. This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.\nAdditionally, the commit messages should start with the Issue ID when applicable.\n\nOnce the feature and corresponding tests are complete, a pull request (PR) will be created using the web interface. The pull request should indicate which feature or defect is being addressed and should provide a high-level description of the changes made.\nCode reviews are performed as part of the pull request procedure. Once a change is ready for review, the author(s) will notify other engineers using an appropriate mechanism, typically by adding reviewers as PR approvers.\n\nOther engineers will review the changes, using the guidelines above.\nEngineers should note all potential issues with the code; it is the responsibility of the author(s) to address those issues or explain why they are not applicable.\nIf changes/commits are made to a PR, it should reset previous approvals and require review and approvals again before the PR can be merged.\nOnce the review process finishes, each reviewer should approve the PR, at which point the original author(s) may merge their change into the main branch (i.e. master).\nPR can only be merged with at least one approval from a reviewer other than the author.\n\nIf the feature or defect interacts with sensitive data, or controls access to sensitive data, or contains security/risky infrastructure changes to the target environment, the code changes must be reviewed by the Security team before the feature is marked as complete.\n\nThis review must include a security analysis for potential vulnerabilities such as those listed in the OWASP Top 10.\nThis review must also verify that any actions performed by authenticated users will generate appropriate audit log entries.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Strategy\nFeatures, enhancements, and bugs are written up as issues (). An engineer on a small team proposes changes necessary and creates a review for the team (). Continuous integration () kicks off unit and functional tests which pass before changes are merged into the repository.

Feature toggle enablement in production can have a few more dependencies than code. Those dependencies include things like external documentation, early access programs, and internal playbooks for supporting the feature.\nDetailed process and procedures for code promotion and production release: See Configuration and Change Management.\n\n\n\nSource Code Management\nCloudCore development/engineering team uses for source code management. Access to and its configuration standards include:\n\nAll developers must authenticate to gain access to and code repos hosted on according to standards and procedures defined in the Access Policy:\n\nAccess control to the web interface must be enabled, via SSO and/or MFA if applicable\nSSH public/private key access may be used for command line or git access to the code repos\n\nAll code repos in follow these configuration standards:\n\nAll repos must have an owner identified and listed\nAll repos are by default private\n\nCertain branch restrictions are enabled, including:\n\nThe master branch cannot be rebased\nRestrict direct commits into master\nRestrict history rewrites of master\nRestrict deletion of master\n\nCertain pull request (PR) requirements are enforced before merging, including:\n\nMust have at least 1 review approval to merge\nMust have at least 1 successful build to merge\nall PR tasks must be completed\n\n\n\n\nHigh Level Application Security Requirements\nAll CloudCore software must be developed to include the following general application security principles and requirements. Web applications must also protect itself against the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n\nProtect sensitive customer data such as PHI, PII and account passwords. Encrypt data stored (at rest).\nSecure data in transit and customer communications via TLS.\nProvision strong access control (authentication and authorisation). Prevent and report unauthorised access.\nLog all transactions and activities to be able to tell who did what, when, where, and how. Mask or remove sensitive data in logs.\nImplement client security at application endpoints (e.g. browser, mobile app).\nCommunicate securely across application endpoints and between service consumers/producers.\nUse secure defaults to ensure security when in all error conditions.\nCheck and maintain the security of all third party and open source libraries/components/dependencies.\nValidate all data inputs; encode data outputs when appropriate.\nDeploy and configure applications securely to production.\nPerform regular vulnerability analysis and apply security patches promptly.\nSecure privileged access to production environments and ensure ongoing application monitoring.\n\nAll software code must complete a set of security scans/testing prior to being deployed to production, including open source dependency scanning, static and dynamic application security testing, as well as periodic penetration testing.\nPre-production testing is performed with nonproduction data in nonproduction environments. Health checks are performed regularly or automated in production.\nSoftware vulnerability identified through any of the above processes shall be reported and tracked following CloudCore Vulnerability Management process as defined in the Vulnerability Management Policy and Procedures.\n\n\nSecure Design and Application Threat Modeling\nCloudCore Security Team in collaboration with development team performs full Application Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment on per-application basis using a custom approach that relies on industry standards and best practices.\nMajor application updates are captured via an RFC process. The RFC template includes Security Consideration as a required section. This section is used to document abuse cases including:\n\nrisks identified,\nattack vectors, and\nmitigating controls.\n\nEach RFC is required to capture sufficient details of the feature/component to be developed, including use cases, motivation and outcome, and the following design details as applicable:\n\nauthentication/authorisation mechanisms,\nnetwork communications,\ndata encryption,\ncloud services used,\nlogging/auditing,\ndata flow diagram/description,\nedge cases, drawbacks, and alternatives.\n\nThe RFC must be approved prior to implementation. Security team is included in RFC reviews via the pull request process.\n\nPlatform Design and DevOps Security Details\nDocumentation on the CloudCore Engineering Wiki may include additional security specifications as well as the security design and implementation details of the CloudCore Platform and its supporting operations.\n\n\n\nAccess Control of the Application (Identification, Authentication, Authorisation, Accounting)\nCloudCore external software application that is customer facing with access to customer specific data, including sensitive information such as PII and ePHI, implements strong access control, covering the Identification, Authentication, Authorisation, and Accounting/Auditing (IAAA) of access and user activity.\nThe implementation ensures that\n\nthe user requesting access is the one claimed (Identification and Authentication);\nonly users authorised to access specific data (such as ePHI) are allowed to (Authorisation); and\ntheir access activities are logs (Accounting/Auditing) according to the CloudCore auditing standards.\n\nThe current implementation leverages AWS Cognito for user identity management and access.\nThe backend platform implements granular Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granting access to specific services and data based on the attribute(s) of a principal (i.e. user requesting access – an attribute could be the role or group membership or organisation the user belongs to) and the attribute(s) of the requested resource (i.e. data or service – an attribute could be the project this data belongs to).\nMore implementation details are documented on the internal Engineering wiki.\n\n\nFree and Open Source Software (FOSS) Security\nCloudCore security and development team implemented a process to\n\nInventory all software dependencies;\nScan software dependencies for known security vulnerability;\nFix any and all high risk findings prior to production; and\nReview and identify licensing issues of the 3rd party software and libraries.\n\nThe current tool in use is Snyk. Snyk supports Node.js, Ruby, and Java. Documentation can be found at the Snyk website.\nSnyk also enables automatic license analysis for dependencies, and this functionality is embedded into the securityScan() pipeline step.\nSnyk can be leveraged in local development environment to scan locally and/or at every build for dev to include dev dependencies.\n\n\nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST)\nTools:\n\nThe Lint and GitLeaks Platform - static and dynamic code analysis. Together with the FOSS security tool, the SAST testing was made available to use via the automated security-scan docker image, as well as integrated into CloudCore pipeline library via the securityScan() step\nManual code security reviews are periodically performed by the Security team as follows:\n\nPeriodic review as part of weekly activities\nEvery pull request which includes security team as approvers\nBy request - issue created on the Security project/board\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\nDynamic testing is available by request to the Security team and is performed using OWASP ZAP. Security team is currently looking into automation of this type of scanning.\nAdditionally, manual baseline dynamic testing is available by request to the Security team.\n\nIntegration of Dynamic testing into automatic tests\nUpon availability of automatic UI tests for applications being developed internally, an extension based on OWASP ZAP is used to transparently work with any UI tests available and automatically add basic dynamic tests into build pipeline.\n\n\n\nPenetration Testing\n\nExternal Penetration Testing\nAn external penetration testing is performed at least once a year by a qualified security researcher / ethical hacker on the security team internally and/or with an external security consulting firm.\n\n\n\nResponsible Disclore and Bug Bounty Program\n\nPublic Vulnerability Disclosure / Bug Bounty Program\nAll technology contains bugs, including both functional defects and security vulnerability.\nCloudCore uses a third party platform to maintain a public vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty program. This program takes advantage of crowd-sourced security researchers to perform penetration testing of CloudCore’s platform and its public facing resources.\nThe current program provider is HackerOne.\n\n\n\nOutsourced Software Development\nCloudCore requires all outsourced software development to follow the same rigor and process as internal engineering. Outsourced developers must develop in our secure environment, accept and follow our security policies and procedures, and comply with the same secure coding standards, including:\n\nReceive regular OWASP or equivalent secure coding training.\nFollow the same source control, code review, and security code scanning procedures as defined.\nInstall endpoint compliance agent that checks to make sure firewall, encryption, patching, password policy, screensaver password, and other required protection is properly configured.\n\nAdditionally, the third party firm providing outsourced development services must demonstrate that they have conducted the appropriate screening during hiring.\n\n\nHIPAA Best Practices for Software Development\n\nUse only HIPAA eligible services in the Cloud (AWS)\nBecause we use the services provided by AWS for our production environment with contains electronic protected health information (ePHI), AWS is a “business associate” of ours. It is required by HIPAA for CloudCore and AWS to enter into a “business associate agreement” (BAA).\nOur fully executed BAA with AWS can be found on the internal document repository.\nWe must only used HIPAA-eligible services covered under the BAA to process and store ePHI. Non-eligible services may be used in support of our cloud infrastructure as long as it does not have access to ePHI.\nA list of HIPAA eligible services can be found here. AWS regularly updates its services to meet HIPAA compliance requirements. Check the page once in a while to find out if new services have been added.\nAdditional References:\n\nArchitecting for HIPAA in the Cloud\nAWS Shared Responsibility Model\nAWS HIPAA Compliance\nAWS HIPAA Compliance Whitepaper\n\n\n\nSeparate access and data between prod and non-prod accounts\nIt is a compliance requirement of multiple regulations to ensure separation of duties between production and non-production environments, including both access and data. Additionally, we should not use production data for dev or test, unless the data has been properly sanitised/masked.\nExamples of regulations and certifications that have this explicit requirement include HIPAA, SAS70/SSAE-17, SOC, PCI, and ISO 27001/27002, many of which are on our target list to be compliant with or certified to.\n\n\nDo not log ePHI\nNot only it is a security best practice to avoid sensitive data such as ePHI in application logging, it may be a contract violation (per AWS BAA) to do so. We must not send any ePHI to non HIPAA eligible services in AWS, such as CloudTrail.\n\n\nInclude the right language in notices\nSpecific language must be included in terms, consents, and notices. For example, we must collect email addresses from patients when they sign up for the PHC, and specify in the terms that we may use the email address provided as a formal method of communication, including breach notification, should a breach occurs that impact their PHI.\n\n\nData protection\nFollow the requirements listed in the following documents:\n\nData Classification Model;\nData Handling Requirements;\nData Protection Policy and Procedures; and\nBackup and Recovery Process.\n\n\n\nRisk Analysis and Compliance Assessment\nRead the latest assessment report for more details on CloudCore’s HIPAA compliance.\n\n\n\nProduction System Monitoring and Paging\nSoftware and systems deployed in production are monitored 24/7 for health check and other major/critical error conditions. The on call team is paged via PagerDuty in the event an error or failure is detected.\nNotifications via additional channels such as Slack and email are also configured."

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nRisk Management Objectives\nCloudCore has established formal risk analysis and risk management processes to\n\nidentify risks that may impact its business operations or the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its critical data; and\nreduce risk to an acceptable level by implementation of mitigation controls.\n\nUnmitigated risk above the pre-defined acceptable level must be reviewed, approved and accepted by senior management.\n\nAcceptable Risk Levels\nRisks that are either low impact or low probability, based on the scoring mechanism defined in risk assessment process, are generally considered acceptable.\nAll other risks must be individually reviewed and managed according to the risk management process.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Process\nRisk analysis and risk management are recognised as important components of CloudCore’s corporate compliance and information security program.\nCloudCore’s risk management process is developed in accordance with the Risk Analysis and Risk Management implementation specifications within the Security Management standard and the evaluation standards set forth in the HIPAA Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A), 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B), 164.308(a)(1)(i), and 164.308(a)(8).\nRisk assessments are done throughout product life cycles:\n\nBefore the integration of new system technologies and before changes are made to CloudCore physical and technical safeguards; and (Note that these changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the CloudCore Platform)\nWhile making changes to CloudCore physical equipment and facilities that introduce new, untested configurations.\n\nCloudCore performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of sensitive data.\nCloudCore implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:\n\nEnsure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all sensitive data CloudCore receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its Customers;\nProtect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hasards to the security or integrity of Customer data and/or sensitive data;\nProtect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer data and/or sensitive data that are not permitted or required; and\nEnsure compliance by all workforce members.\n\nIn addition, CloudCore risk management process requires that:\n\nAny risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied, requires sign off by the senior management and CloudCore’s Security Officer.\nAll CloudCore workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation, as outlined in the CloudCore Roles Policy.\nThe implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of CloudCore’s Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.\nAll risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.\nThe details of the Risk Management Process, including risk assessment, discovery, and mitigation, are outlined in detail below. The process is tracked, measured, and monitored using the following procedures:\n\nThe Security Officer or the Privacy Officer initiates the Risk Management Procedures by creating an Issue in the Security Project.\nThe Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to carry out the Risk Management Procedures.\nAll findings are documented and linked to the Issue.\nOnce the Risk Assessment steps are complete, along with corresponding documentation, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\nIf the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.\n\nThe Risk Management Procedure is monitored on a quarterly basis using reporting to assess compliance with above policy.\n\nThird party risk management details including procurement and systems acquisition can be found in §vendor.\n\nRisk Management Schedule\nThe two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of CloudCore’s information security program:\n\nScheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of CloudCore’s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.\nThroughout a System’s Development Life Cycle - from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.\nAs Needed - the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect CloudCore’s Platform.\n\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment and Analysis\nThe intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.\n\nStep 1. System Characterisation\n\nThe first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where sensitive data is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the CloudCore Platform boundaries are identified.\nOutput - Characterisation of the CloudCore Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.\n\nStep 2. Threat Identification\n\nPotential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a list of potential threats.\nOutput - A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.\n\nStep 3. Vulnerability Identification\n\nDevelop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organisation’s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organisation’s computer network.\nOutput - A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.\n\nStep 4. Control Analysis\n\nDocument and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by CloudCore to minimise or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.\nOutput - List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.\n\nStep 5. Likelihood Determination\n\nDetermine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.\nOutput - Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\nStep 6. Impact Analysis\n\nDetermine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to CloudCore’s mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.\nOutput - Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\nStep 7. Risk Determination\n\nEstablish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.\nOutput - Risk level of low (1-10), medium (&gt;10-50) or high (&gt;50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.\n\nStep 8. Control Recommendations\n\nIdentify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organisation’s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organisational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritised, and implemented.\nOutput - Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.\n\nStep 9. Results Documentation\n\nResults of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.\nOutput - A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.\n\n\n\n\nRisk Mitigation and Monitoring\nRisk mitigation involves prioritising, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of CloudCore Platform data. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organisation consistent with its goals and mission.\n\nStep 1. Prioritise Actions\n\nUsing results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritised list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources\nOutput - Actions ranked from high to low\n\nStep 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options\n\nAlthough possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analysed. In the end, select a “most appropriate” control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.\nOutput - list of feasible controls\n\nStep 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nDetermine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analysing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritising across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.\nOutput - Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control\n\nStep 4. Select Control(s)\n\nTaking into account the information and results from previous steps, CloudCore’s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.\nOutput - Selected control(s)\n\nStep 5. Assign Responsibility\n\nIdentify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.\nOutput - List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments\n\nStep 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan\n\nDevelop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:\n\nEach risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;\nPrioritised actions;\nThe recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;\nRequired resources for implementation of selected controls;\nTeam member responsible for implementation of each control;\nStart date for implementation\nTarget date for completion of implementation;\nMaintenance requirements.\n\nThe overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals’ time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to CloudCore Senior Management.\nIndividual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframe and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.\nOutput - Safeguard Implementation Plan\n\nStep 7. Implement Selected Controls\n\nAs controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.\nContinually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.\nAdditional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organisational or process changes, or major facilities changes.\nIf risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.\nOutput - Residual Risk documentation\n\n\n\n\nRisk Registry\nCloudCore Security team maintains a registry of risks, captured and kept updated\n\nin a document on company SharePoint; and/or\nin the security operations tool/database.\n\nThe risk registry includes all risks and threats identified during annual risk assessment and all interim reviews.\n\n\nCyber Liability Insurance\nCloudCore holds cyber liability insurance with sufficient coverage based on the organisation’s risk profile.\nOur current cyber policy is covered by .\n\n\nFraud Risks\nDue to its transparent culture, team sise and operating model, including separation of duties, comprehensive controls, continuous monitoring and auditing, CloudCore considers its fraud-related risk to be very low.\nCloudCore hires to perform accounting services and annual financial audits.\nFraud risk is re-evaluated as part of the organisation’s annual risk assessment. The assessment considers the following aspects of fraud:\n\nPressures and/or incentives\nOpportunities\nRationalities\n\nFinancial-related fraud assessment is led by the COO/CFO.\nIT-related fraud assessment is led by the Compliance Officer or CISO.\n\nPotential Frauds and Likelihood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFraud Risk\nLikelihood\nIn Place Controls/Monitors\n\n\n\n\nFraudulent Financial Reporting\nLow\nMonthly executive team reviews of business plan and revenue; Financial review by external accounting firm\n\n\nMisappropriation of Assets\nLow\nExpense reporting and asset tracking in place\n\n\nRegulatory and Legal Misconduct\nLow\nAudit and compliance policies and processes, including whistleblower procedures; engage external law firm to review legal conduct\n\n\nPayroll Fraud\nLow\nPayroll is reviewed by at least two people internally as well as by external accounting firm\n\n\nKickbacks / Conflict of Interest\nLow\nTeam-based vendor review and selection process\n\n\nMisuse of Cloud Resources\nLow\nContinuous resource monitoring for all cloud accounts and regions and expense monitoring\n\n\nOther IT Fraud\nLow\nIT assets and resources tracking"

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nSecurity Incident Response Team (SIRT)\nThe Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) is responsible for:\n\nReview, analyse and log of all received reports and track their statuses.\nPerforming investigations, creating and executing action plans, post-incident activities.\nCollaboration with law enforcement agencies.\n\nCurrent members of the CloudCore SIRT:\n\nSecurity and Privacy Officer\nSecurity Engineers\nHead of Engineering\nDevOps and Production Support Team\n\n\n\nIncident Management Process\nThe CloudCore incident response process follows the process recommended by SANS, an industry leader in security. Process flows are a direct representation of the SANS process which can be found in this document.\nCloudCore’s incident response classifies security-related events into the following categories:\n\nEvents - Any observable computer security-related occurrence in a system or network with a negative consequence. Examples:\n\nHardware component failing causing service outages.\nSoftware error causing service outages.\nGeneral network or system instability.\n\nPrecursors - A sign that an incident may occur in the future. Examples:\n\nMonitoring system showing unusual behaviour.\nAudit log alerts indicated several failed login attempts.\nSuspicious emails targeting specific CloudCore staff members with administrative access to production systems.\nAlerts raised from a security control source based on its monitoring policy, such as\n\nOkta (user authentication activities)\nThreat Stack (AWS Cloudtrail events or system agent activities)\nDome9 (cloud services configuration or access alerts)\nCarbon Black Cb Defence (malware and endpoint events)\nSyslog events from servers\n\n\nIndications - A sign that an incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time. Examples:\n\nAlerts for modified system files or unusual system accesses.\nAntivirus alerts for infected files or devices.\nExcessive network traffic directed at unexpected geographic locations.\n\nIncidents - A confirmed attack / indicator of compromise or a validated violation of computer security policies or acceptable use policies, often resulting in data breaches. Examples:\n\nUnauthorised disclosure of sensitive data.\nUnauthorised change or destruction of sensitive data.\nA data breach accomplished by an internal or external entity.\nA Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack causing a critical service to become unreachable.\n\n\nCloudCore employees must report any unauthorised or suspicious activity seen on production systems or associated with related communication systems (such as email or Slack). In practice this means keeping an eye out for security events, and letting the Security team know about any observed precursors or indications as soon as they are discovered.\n!!! Attention\nIncidents of a severity/impact rating higher than **MINOR** shall trigger the\nfollowing response process, or as defined more specifically in the **Incident\nCategories and Playbooks** section.\n\nI - Identification and Triage\n\nImmediately upon observation CloudCore members report suspected and known Events, Precursors, Indications, and Incidents in one of the following ways:\n\nDirect report to management, the Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or other;\nEmail;\nPhone call;\nSubmit an incident report online via CloudCore Internal ServiceDesk;\nSecure chat; or\nAnonymously through workforce members desired channels.\n\nThe individual receiving the report facilitates the collection of additional information about the incident, as needed, and notifies the Security Officer (if not already done).\nThe Security Officer determines if the issue is an Event, Precursor, Indication, or Incident.\n\nIf the issue is an event, indication, or precursor the Security Officer forwards it to the appropriate resource for resolution.\n\nNon-Technical Event (minor infringement): the Security Officer of designee creates an appropriate issue in and further investigates the incident as needed.\nTechnical Event: Assign the issue to an technical resource for resolution. This resource may also be a contractor or outsourced technical resource, in the event of a lack of resource or expertise in the area.\n\nIf the issue is a security incident the Security Officer activates the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and notifies senior leadership by email.\n\nIf a non-technical security incident is discovered the SIRT completes the investigation, implements preventative measures, and resolves the security incident.\nOnce the investigation is completed, progress to Phase V, Follow-up.\nIf the issue is a technical security incident, commence to Phase II: Containment.\nThe Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phases are highly technical. It is important to have them completed by a highly qualified technical security resource with oversight by the SIRT team.\nEach individual on the SIRT and the technical security resource document all measures taken during each phase, including the start and end times of all efforts.\nThe lead member of the SIRT team facilitates initiation of an Incident ticket in Security Project and documents all findings and details in the ticket.\n\nThe intent of the Incident ticket is to provide a summary of all events, efforts, and conclusions of each Phase of this policy and procedures.\nEach Incident ticket should contain sufficient details following the SANS Security Incident Forms templates, as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or CloudCore representative appointed notifies any affected Customers and Partners. If no Customers and Partners are affected, notification is at the discretion of the Security and Privacy Officer.\nIn the case of a threat identified, the Security Officer is to form a team to investigate and involve necessary resources, both internal to CloudCore and potentially external.\n\n\n\nII - Containment (Technical)\nIn this Phase, CloudCore’s engineers and security team attempts to contain the security incident. It is extremely important to take detailed notes during the security incident response process. This provides that the evidence gathered during the security incident can be used successfully during prosecution, if appropriate.\n\nReview any information that has been collected by the Security team or any other individual investigating the security incident.\nSecure the blast radius (i.e. a physical or logical network perimeter or access sone).\nPerform the following forensic analysis preparation, as needed:\n\nSecurely connect to the affected system over a trusted connection.\nRetrieve any volatile data from the affected system.\nDetermine the relative integrity and the appropriateness of backing the system up.\nAs necessary, take a snapshot of the disk image for further forensic; and if appropriate, back up the system.\nChange the password(s) to the affected system(s).\nDetermine whether it is safe to continue operations with the affect system(s).\nIf it is safe, allow the system to continue to function; and move to Phase V, Post Incident Analysis and Follow-up.\nIf it is NOT safe to allow the system to continue operations, discontinue the system(s) operation and move to Phase III, Eradication.\nThe individual completing this phase provides written communication to the SIRT.\n\nComplete any documentation relative to the security incident containment on the Incident ticket, using SANS IH Containment Form as a template.\nContinuously apprise Senior Management of progress.\nContinue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed.\n\n\n\nIII - Eradication (Technical)\nThe Eradication Phase represents the SIRT’s effort to remove the cause, and the resulting security exposures, that are now on the affected system(s).\n\nDetermine symptoms and cause related to the affected system(s).\nStrengthen the defences surrounding the affected system(s), where possible (a risk assessment may be needed and can be determined by the Security Officer). This may include the following:\n\nAn increase in network perimeter defences.\nAn increase in system monitoring defences.\nRemediation (“fixing”) any security issues within the affected system, such as removing unused services/general host hardening techniques.\n\nConduct a detailed vulnerability assessment to verify all the holes/gaps that can be exploited have been addressed.\n\nIf additional issues or symptoms are identified, take appropriate preventative measures to eliminate or minimise potential future compromises.\n\nUpdate the Incident ticket with Eradication details, using SANS IH Eradication Form as a template.\nUpdate the documentation with the information learned from the vulnerability assessment, including the cause, symptoms, and the method used to fix the problem with the affected system(s).\nApprise Senior Management of the progress.\nContinue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed.\nMove to Phase IV, Recovery.\n\n\n\nIV - Recovery (Technical)\nThe Recovery Phase represents the SIRT’s effort to restore the affected system(s) back to operation after the resulting security exposures, if any, have been corrected.\n\nThe technical team determines if the affected system(s) have been changed in any way.\n\nIf they have, the technical team restores the system to its proper, intended functioning (“last known good”).\nOnce restored, the team validates that the system functions the way it was intended/had functioned in the past. This may require the involvement of the business unit that owns the affected system(s).\nIf operation of the system(s) had been interrupted (i.e., the system(s) had been taken offline or dropped from the network while triaged), restart the restored and validated system(s) and monitor for behaviour.\nIf the system had not been changed in any way, but was taken offline (i.e., operations had been interrupted), restart the system and monitor for proper behaviour.\nUpdate the documentation with the detail that was determined during this phase.\nApprise Senior Management of progress.\nContinue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed.\nMove to Phase V, Follow-up.\n\n\n\n\nV - Post-Incident Analysis (Technical and Non-Technical)\nThe Follow-up phase represents the review of the security incident to look for “lessons learned” and to determine whether the process that was taken could have been improved in any way. It is recommended all security incidents be reviewed shortly after resolution to determine where response could be improved. Timeframes may extend to one to two weeks post-incident.\n\nResponders to the security incident (SIRT Team and technical security resource) meet to review the documentation collected during the security incident.\nA “lessons learned” section is written and attached to Incident ticket.\n\nEvaluate the cost and impact of the security incident to CloudCore using the documents provided by the SIRT and the technical security resource.\nDetermine what could be improved. This may include:\n\nSystems and processes adjustments\nAwareness training and documentation\nImplementation of additional controls\n\nCommunicate these findings to Senior Management for approval and for implementation of any recommendations made post-review of the security incident.\nCarry out recommendations approved by Senior Management; sufficient budget, time and resources should be committed to this activity.\n\nEnsure all incident related information is recorded and retained as described in CloudCore Auditing requirements and Data Retention standards.\nClose the security incident.\n\n\n\nPeriodic Evaluation\nIt is important to note that the processes surrounding security incident response should be periodically reviewed and evaluated for effectiveness. This also involves appropriate training of resources expected to respond to security incidents, as well as the training of the general population regarding the CloudCore’s expectation for them, relative to security responsibilities. The incident response plan is tested annually.\n\n\n\nIncident Categories and Playbooks\n\nThe IRT reviews and analyses on the security events on as part of its daily operations.\nBased on the initial analysis, an event may be dismissed due to false positives, normal business operations, exceptions that are already in place, permitted per policy, or duplicates. An audit trail will be kept for event dismissal.\nA valid security event may be upgrade to a security incident. Upon which, an incident classification and severity is assigned as specified below.\nRecord of the decision must be stored with details on date(s), name(s) of the person(s) conducted assessment.\nA containment, eradication and recovery procedure is triggered based on the Category classification of the incident.\nIn addition to the general incident management procedures previously described, one or more of the following playbooks are consulted based on the classification of a particular incident.\n\n\nClassification\n\nCategory 1 – General Incidents, including physical security incidents\nCategory 2 – Attacks on internal corporate infrastructure, including network, hardware, software\nCategory 3 – Malware\nCategory 4 – Attacks on external facing assets, such as website, web applications, web services. Including denial of service attacks.\nCategory 5 – Human targets, social engineering, phishing, etc.\nCategory 6 – Breach/leakage of critical or confidential data\n\n\n\nSeverity Levels:\n\nCritical – incident that involves immediate and significant interruption to business operations and/or breach of critical or confidential data\nMajor – incident that involves immediate interruption to business operations but will not likely result in immediate data breach\nMinor – all other confirmed incidents\n\n\n\nResponse Procedures: Cat 1 – General Incident\n\nPrioritise handling the incident based on functional impact, informational effort, recoverability efforts and other relevant factors\nReport the incident to the appropriate internal personnel and external organisations\nAcquire, preserve, secure, and document evidence\nContain the incident\nEradicate the incident\n\nIdentify and mitigate all factors that enabled the incident to occur\nRemove any results of malicious activity\n\nRecover from the incident\n\nRestore affected systems and business functions\nImplement additional preventive measures\n\n\n\n\nResponse Procedures: Cat 2 – Internal Infrastructure Incident Response\nDepending on the type of event, use the following incident response playbooks:\n\nUnauthorised Access\nRoot Access\nElevation of Privilege\nImproper Usage\n\n\n\nResponse Procedures: Cat 3 – Malware outbreak\nDepending on the agent type, follow these incident response playbooks:\n\nMalware\nVirus\n\n\n\nResponse Procedures: Cat 4 – External web attacks and DoS/DDoS attacks\n\nMobilise the Engineering team to secure systems and ensure Business Continuity\nConduct a thorough investigation of the incident\nManage public relationships\nAddress legal and regulatory requirements\nFor a DDOS attack, follow the DDOS playbook\nTrigger BCDR if necessary\n\n\n\nResponse Procedures: Cat 5 – Social Engineering\nFollow the Phishing incident response playbook\n\n\nResponse Procedures: Cat 6 – Data Leakage\nData Theft incident response playbook outlines the response instructions\n\n\nResponse Procedures: Special Cases\nAt least the following two special cases are considered when responding to an incident:\nPHI/ePHI:\nWhen a data breach occurs that involves unsecured PHI or ePHI, breach notifications must be performed according to HIPAA regulation requirements, including each individual impacted and as applicable, the covered entity and OCR (see Appendix for additional details).\nIf the breach or potential breach impacts PHI/ePHI that belongs to a Covered Entity to which CloudCore is a Business Associate of, the IRT and management team will inform the Covered Entity per the timeframe and contact method established in the Business Associate Agreement or as described in §Breach Notification. HIPAA §164.410(b)\nCriminal Activities:\nIn the event of an attack that involves suspected criminal activities, the IRT and management team will inform law enforcement.\nInsider Threat:\nMembers of the cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team include:\n\nSecurity and Privacy Officer,\nCOO, and\nHead of Engineering as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Operations Mode\nIf an incident constitutes an emergency – for example, a detected cyberattack that impacts production systems – CloudCore plans to operate in a “read-only” mode, to continue to provide customers access to their data. All write access is temporarily blocked and data upload is paused until the emergency is resolved. This is accomplished by updating the access policy in production AWS environments.\nIn emergency operations mode, temporary access may be granted to security and/or engineering team to access the production environments to perform forensics, root cause analysis, eradication/remediation, or other necessary activities for incident recovery.\n\n\nTabletop Exercise\nAt least once per year, CloudCore security and engineering teams jointly performs a Red Team exercise and/or a simulated “drill” of an emergency cyberattack that results in one or more CRITICAL incidents. Depending on the type of exercise, the duration may range from 2-4 hours (simulated “drill”) to a couple of weeks (full Red Teaming exercise).\nThe exercise will follow a cyberattack playbook. It may be conducted with all internal resources or with the help of an external security consulting firm. The goal of the exercise is to ensure all parties involved receive proper training to handle an actual incident and to test out the documented procedures in order to identify gaps ahead of a real event. Senior leadership team may be invited to participate in the “drill” depending on the nature of the exercise or receive a readout of the outcome.\n\n\nIncident Tracking and Records\nA record is created for each reported incident in Jira. Each incident record contains details about the incident capturing the incident attributes and progression, including the following as applicable:\n\nSummary\nDescription\nImpact\nPriority / Urgency\nCategorisation\nAnalysis Notes and Comments\nCause / Determination\nOutcome / Resolution\nLessons Learned\n\nIf a more detailed post-mortem is applicable, the Security and/or DevOps team will create the write-up and link it in the incident record."

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nBCDR Objectives and Roles\n\nObjectives\nThe following objectives have been established for this plan:\n\nMaximise the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of the following phases:\n\nNotification/Activation phase to detect and assess damage and to activate the plan;\nRecovery phase to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage done to the original system;\nReconstitution phase to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal operations.\n\nIdentify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out CloudCore processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations.\nIdentify and define the impact of interruptions to CloudCore systems.\nAssign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for recovering CloudCore during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations.\nEnsure coordination with other CloudCore staff who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.\nEnsure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.\n\nExample of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats, and internal malicious activities.\nCloudCore defined two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective.\n\nCritical Systems. These systems host production application servers/services and database servers/services or are required for functioning of systems that host production applications and data. These systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored, or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming unavailable.\nNon-critical Systems. These are all systems not considered critical by definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a lower priority than critical systems.\n\n\n\nLine of Succession\nThe following order of succession to ensure that decision-making authority for the CloudCore Contingency Plan is uninterrupted. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) is responsible for ensuring the safety of personnel and the execution of procedures documented within this CloudCore Contingency Plan. The Head of Engineering is responsible for the recovery of CloudCore technical environments. If the COO or Head of Engineering is unable to function as the overall authority or chooses to delegate this responsibility to a successor, the CEO shall function as that authority or choose an alternative delegate. To provide contact initiation should the contingency plan need to be initiated, please use the contact list below.\n\nJoe Blog, COO:\nSteve PLanter, Head of Engineering:\nLeo Kelp, CEO:\n\n\n\nResponse Teams and Responsibilities\nThe following teams have been developed and trained to respond to a contingency event affecting CloudCore infrastructure and systems.\n\nIT is responsible for recovery of the CloudCore hosted environment, network devices, and all servers. The team includes personnel responsible for the daily IT operations and maintenance. The team leader is the IT Manager who reports to the COO.\nHR & Facilities is responsible for ensuring the physical safety of all CloudCore personnel and environmental safety at each CloudCore physical location. The team members also include site leads at each CloudCore work site. The team leader is the Facilities Manager who reports to the COO.\nDevOps is responsible for assuring all applications, web services, platform and their supporting infrastructure in the Cloud. The team is also responsible for testing re-deployments and assessing damage to the environment. The team leader is the Head of Engineering.\nSecurity is responsible for assessing and responding to all cybersecurity related incidents according to CloudCore Incident Response policy and procedures. The security team shall assist the above teams in recovery as needed in non-cybersecurity events. The team leader is the Security Officer.\n\nMembers of above teams must maintain local copies of the contact information of the BCDR succession team. Additionally, the team leads must maintain a local copy of this policy in the event Internet access is not available during a disaster scenario.\nAll executive leadership shall be informed of any and all contingency events. Current members of CloudCore leadership team include the .\n\n\n\nGeneral Disaster Recovery Procedures\n\nNotification and Activation Phase\nThis phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage inflicted by a disruption to CloudCore. Based on the assessment of the Event, sometimes according to the CloudCore Incident Response Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the COO or Head of Engineering. The Contingency Plan may also be activated by the Security Officer in the event of a cyber disaster.\nThe notification sequence is listed below:\n\nThe first responder is to notify the COO. All known information must be relayed to the COO.\nThe COO is to contact the Response Teams and inform them of the event. The COO or delegate is responsible to begin assessment procedures.\nThe COO is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the COO is to following the steps below.\n\nDamage Assessment Procedures:\nThe COO is to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.\nAlternate Assessment Procedures:\nUpon notification, the COO is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with the Response Teams.\n\nThe CloudCore Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\nCloudCore will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.\nOn-premise hosting facility or cloud infrastructure service is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.\nOther criteria, as appropriate and as defined by CloudCore.\n\nIf the plan is to be activated, the COO is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required.\nUpon notification from the COO, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.\nThe COO is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site.\nThe COO is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.\nNotification can be message, email, or phone.\n\n\n\nRecovery Phase\nThis section provides procedures for recovering CloudCore infrastructure and operations at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair damage to the original system and capabilities.\nProcedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations.\nRecovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild CloudCore infrastructure to a production state.\nThe tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel.\n\nContact Partners and Customers affected to begin initial communication - DevOps\nAssess damage to the environment - DevOps\nCreate a new production environment using new environment bootstrap automation - DevOps\nEnsure secure access to the new environment - Security\nBegin code deployment and data replication using pre-established automation - DevOps\nTest new environment and applications using pre-written tests - DevOps\nTest logging, security, and alerting functionality - DevOps and Security\nAssure systems and applications are appropriately patched and up to date - DevOps\nUpdate DNS and other necessary records to point to new environment - DevOps\nUpdate Partners and Customers affected through established channels - DevOps\n\n\n\nReconstitution Phase\nThis section discusses activities necessary for restoring full CloudCore operations at the original or new site. The goal is to restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. If necessary, when the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored, CloudCore operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back. The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate site to the computer center.\n\nOriginal or New Site Restoration\n\nRepeat steps 5-9 in the Recovery Phase at the original or new site / environment.\nRestoration of Original site is unnecessary for cloud environments, except when required for forensic purpose.\n\nPlan Deactivation\n\nIf the CloudCore environment is moved back to the original site from the alternative site, all hardware used at the alternate site should be handled and disposed of according to the CloudCore Media Disposal Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting and Maintenance\nThe COO and/or Head of Engineering shall establish criteria for validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for personnel involved in the plan’s execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will satisfy the annual requirement.\n\nTabletop Testing\nTabletop Testing is conducted in accordance with the CMS Risk Management Handbook, Volume 2. The primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are knowledgeable and capable of performing the notification/activation requirements and procedures as outlined in the CP, in a timely manner. The exercises include, but are not limited to:\n\nTesting to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific crisis.\n\n\n\nSimulation and/or Technical Testing\nThe primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication processes and data storage and recovery processes can function at an alternate site to perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the designated requirements. Technical testing shall include, but is not limited to:\n\nProcess from backup system at the alternate site;\nRestore system using backups; and\nSwitch compute and storage resources to alternate processing site.\n\n\n\n\nWork Site Recovery\nIn the event a CloudCore facility is not functioning due to a disaster, employees will work from home or locate to a secondary site with Internet access, until the physical recovery of the facility impacted is complete. The recovery shall be performed by the facility management firm under contract with CloudCore, and coordinated by the Facility Manager and/or the Site Lead.\nCloudCore’s software development organisation has the ability to work from any location with Internet access and does not require an office provided Internet connection.\n\n\nApplication Service Event Recovery\nCloudCore will develop a status page to provide real time update and inform our customers of the status of each service. The status page is updated with details about an event that may cause service interruption / downtime.\nA follow up root-cause analysis details (RCA) will be available to customers upon request after the event has transpired for further details to cause and remediation plan for the future. Event Service Level\n\nShort (hours)\n\nExperience a short delay in service.\nCloudCore will monitor the event and determine course of action. Escalation may be required.\n\n\n\nModerate (days)\n\nExperience a modest delay in service where processes in flight may need to be restarted.\nCloudCore will monitor the event and determine course of action. Escalation may be required.\nCloudCore will notify customers of delay in service and provide updates on CloudCore’s status page.\n\n\n\nLong (a week or more)\n\nExperience a delay in service and processes in flight may need to be restarted.\nCloudCore will monitor the event and determine course of action. Escalation may be required.\nCloudCore will notify customers of delay in service and provide updates on CloudCore’s status page.\n\n\n\n\nProduction Environments and Data Recovery\nProduction data is to be synchronised across multiple S3 buckets in AWS. Additionally, it is backed up to AWS Glacier for long term storage and recovery. In an event that requires data to be recovered, it will be retrieved from Glacier.\nCloudCore assumes that in the worst-case scenario, that one of the production environments suffers a complete data loss, the account will be reconstructed from code, and the data restored from Glacier that is hosted within a different AWS account and geolocation.\nRecovery of production Environments and data should follow the procedures listed above and in Data Management - Backup and Recovery"

CloudCore shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)\nBreach Investigation: The CloudCore Security Officer shall name an individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security officer, risk manager, etc.). The investigator shall be responsible for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organisation as appropriate (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.). All documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of seven years. A breach log is kept and maintained by the Security and Privacy Officer.\nRisk Assessment: A risk assessment is performed in accordance to applicable laws and regulations.\nFor an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure and occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires further notification, the organisation will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organisation shall document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The organisation has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organisation will determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address:\n\nConsideration of who impermissibility used or to whom the information was impermissibility disclosed;\nThe type and amount of ePHI involved;\nThe cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either Customer, CloudCore, or Partner.\nThe potential for significant risk of financial, reputation, or other harm.\n\nTimeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made to the affected CloudCore Customers, usually within 24-48 hours but no later than 10 calendar days after the discovery of the breach. It is the responsibility of the organisation to demonstrate that all notifications were made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of delay.\nDelay of Notification Authorised for Law Enforcement Purposes: If a law enforcement official states to the organisation that a notification, notice, or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, the organisation shall:\n\nIf the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the timer period specified by the official; or\nIf the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification, notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is submitted during that time.\n\nContent of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must contain the following information:\n\nA brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;\nA description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code or other types of information were involved), if known;\nAny steps the Customer should take to protect Customer data from potential harm resulting from the breach.\nA brief description of what CloudCore is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Customers, and to protect against further breaches.\nContact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which may include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, a web site, or postal address.\n\nMethods of Notification: CloudCore Customers will be notified via email and phone within the time frame for reporting breaches, as outlined above.\nMaintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to the reports created for each incident, CloudCore shall maintain a process to record or log all breaches of unsecured sensitive data regardless of the number of records and Customers affected. The following information should be collected/logged for each breach (see sample Breach Notification Log):\n\nA description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers affected, if known.\nA description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, etc.), if known.\nA description of the action taken with regard to notification of patients regarding the breach.\nResolution steps taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future occurrences.\n\nWorkforce Training: CloudCore shall train all members of its workforce on the policies and procedures with respect to sensitive data as necessary and appropriate for the members to carry out their job responsibilities. Workforce members shall also be trained as to how to identify and report breaches within the organisation.\nComplaints: CloudCore must provide a process for individuals to make complaints concerning the organisation’s patient privacy policies and procedures or its compliance with such policies and procedures.\nSanctions: The organisation shall have in place and apply appropriate sanctions against members of its workforce, Customers, and Partners who fail to comply with privacy policies and procedures.\nRetaliation/Waiver: CloudCore may not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual for the exercise by the individual of any privacy right. The organisation may not require individuals to waive their privacy rights under as a condition of the provision of treatment, payment, enrolment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits.\n\n\n\nCloudCore Platform Customer Responsibilities\nThe following requirements and guidelines shall be provided to and agreed upon by a client organisation using CloudCore platform to host sensitive data such as ePHI and PII.\nThe agreement may be in the form of a contract or acceptance of terms and conditions.\n\nThe CloudCore Customer that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores, destroys, or otherwise holds, uses, or discloses unsecured sensitive data shall, without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 72 hours after discovery of a breach, notify CloudCore of such breach. The Customer shall provide CloudCore with the following information:\n\nA description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers affected, if known.\nA description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, etc.), if known.\nA description of the action taken with regard to notification of patients regarding the breach.\nResolution steps taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future occurrences.\n\nDepending on the nature of the breach, an investigation may be conducted by CloudCore or the Customer or jointly to determine the cause of breach.\nNotice to Media: Unless CloudCore is directly at fault for the cause of breach, CloudCore Customers are responsible for providing notice to prominent media outlets at the Customer’s discretion.\nNotice to Authorities: Unless CloudCore is directly at fault for the cause of breach, CloudCore Customers are responsible for providing notice to the appropriate authorities, including the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and your Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA) under GDPR, at the Customer’s discretion.\n\n\n\nSample Letter to Customers in Case of Breach\n[Date]\n\n[Name]\n[Name of Customer]\n[Address 1]\n[Address 2]\n[City, State Zip Code]\n\nDear [Name of Customer]:\n\nI am writing to you from CloudCore, with important information about a recent\nbreach that affects your account with us.

    "title": "Data Protection",
    "section": "Controls and Procedures",
    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nData Protection Implementation and Processes\nData is classified and handled according to the CloudCore Data Handling Specifications and Data Classification document.\nCritical, confidential and internal data will be tagged upon creation, if tagging is supported. Each tag maps to a data type defined in the data classification scheme, which then maps to a protection level for encryption, access control, backup, and retention. Data classification may alternatively be identified by its location/repository. For example, source codes in CloudCore’s repos are considered “Internal” by default, even though a tag is not directly applied to each source file.\nCritical and confidential data is always stored and transmitted securely, using approved encryption standards. More details are specified in CloudCore’s Data Classification and Handling document.\nAll IT systems that process and store sensitive data follow the provisioning process, configuration, change management, patching and anti-malware standards as defined in Configuration and Change Management document.\n\nCustomer/Production Data Protection\nCloudCore hosts on Amason Web Services in the US-East (Ohio) region by default. Data is replicated across multiple regions for redundancy and disaster recovery.\nAll CloudCore employees, systems, and resources adhere to the following standards and processes to reduce the risk of compromise of Production Data:\n\nImplement and/or review controls designed to protect Production Data from improper alteration or destruction.\nEnsure that confidential data is stored in a manner that supports user access logs and automated monitoring for potential security incidents.\nEnsure CloudCore Customer Production Data is segmented and only accessible to Customer authorised to access data.\nAll Production Data at rest is stored on encrypted volumes using encryption keys managed by CloudCore. Encryption at rest is ensured through the use of automated deployment scripts referenced in Configuration and Change Management.\nVolume encryption keys and machines that generate volume encryption keys are protected from unauthorised access. Volume encryption key material is protected with access controls such that the key material is only accessible by privileged accounts.\nEncrypted volumes use approved cipher algorithms, key strength, and key management process as defined in §12.3.1 above.\nRaid volume drives are individually encrypted and assembled on boot requiring a manual input of the key to mount the encrypted volume.\n\n\n\nAccess\nCloudCore employee access to production is guarded by an approval process and by default is disabled. When access is approved, temporary access is granted that allows access to production. Production access is reviewed by the security team on a case by case basis.\n\n\nSeparation\nCustomer data is logically separated at the database/datastore level using a unique identifier for the institution. The separation is enforced at the API layer where the client must authenticate with a chosen institution and then the customer unique identifier is included in the access token and used by the API to restrict access to data to the institution. All database/datastore queries then include the institution identifier.\n\n\nBackup and Recovery\nFor details on the backup and recovery process, see controls and procedures defined in Data Management.\n\n\nMonitoring\nCloudCore uses AWS CloudWatch/CloudTrail to monitor the entire cloud service operation. If a system failure and alarm is triggered, key personnel are notified by text, chat, and/or email message in order to take appropriate corrective action. Escalation may be required and there is an on-call rotation for major services when further support is necessary.\nCloudCore uses a security agent to monitor production systems. The agents monitor system activities, generate alerts on suspicious activities and report on vulnerability findings to a centralised management console.\nThe security agent is installed on all on premise Linux servers. It is also built into Amason Machine Images (AMIs) for use in CloudCore AWS environments.\n\n\n\nProtecting Data At Rest\n\nEncryption of Data at Rest\nAll databases, data stores, and file systems are encrypted with AES-256 using separate keys for each storage type. The keys are rotated periodically.\n\n\nLocal Disk/Volume Encryption\nEncryption and key management for local disk encryption of on-premise servers and end-user devices follow the defined best practices for Windows, macOS, and Linux/Unix operating systems, such as Bitlocker and FileVault.\n\n\n\nProtecting Data In Transit\n\nAll external data transmission is encrypted end-to-end using encryption keys managed by CloudCore. This includes, but is not limited to, cloud infrastructure and third party vendors and applications.\nTransmission encryption keys and systems that generate keys are protected from unauthorised access. Transmission encryption key materials are protected with access controls, and may only be accessed by privileged accounts.\nTransmission encryption keys use a minimum of 4096-bit RSA keys, or keys and ciphers of equivalent or higher cryptographic strength (e.g., 256-bit AES session keys in the case of IPSec encryption).\nTransmission encryption keys are limited to use for one year and then must be regenerated.\nFor all CloudCore APIs, enforcement of authentication, authorisation, and auditing is used for all remote systems sending, receiving, or storing data.\nSystem logs of all transmissions of Production Data access are kept. These logs must be available for audit.\n\n\nEncryption of Data in Transit\nAll internet and intranet connections are encrypted and authenticated using TLS 1.2 (a strong protocol), ECDHE_RSA with P-256 (a strong key exchange), and AES_128_GCM (a strong cipher).\n\n\nData protection via end-user messaging channels\nRestricted and sensitive data is not allowed to be sent over electronic end-user messaging channels such as email or chat, unless end-to-end encryption is enabled.\n\n\n\nProtecting Data In Use\nData in Use, sometimes known as Data in Process, refers to active data being processed by systems and applications which is typically stored in a non-persistent digital state such as in computer random-access memory (RAM), CPU caches, or CPU registers.\nProtection of data in use relies on application layer controls and system access controls. See the Production Security / SDLC and Access sections for details.\nCloudCore applications implement logical account-level data segregation to protect data in a multi-tenancy deployment. In addition, CloudCore applications may incorporate advanced security features such as Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) modules and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) for protection of data in use.\n\n\nEncryption Key Management\nCloudCore uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption key management.\n\nKMS keys are unique to CloudCore environments and services.\nKMS keys are automatically rotated yearly.\n\n\n\nCertificate Management\nCloudCore uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and LetsEncrypt for certificate management.\n\nCertificates are renewed automatically.\nSecurity team monitors the certificates for expiration, potential compromise and use/validity. Certificate revocation process is invoked if the certificate is no longer needed or upon discovery of potential compromise.\n\n\n\nData Integrity Protection\nWhen appropriate, CloudCore engineering should implement “Versioning” and “Lifecycle”, or equivalent data management mechanism, such that direct edit and delete actions are not allowed on the data to prevent accidental or malicious overwrite. This protects against human errors and cyberattacks such as ransomware.\nIn AWS, the IAM and S3 bucket policy in production will be implemented accordingly when the environments are configured. When changes must be made, a new version is created instead of editing and overwriting existing data.\n\nAll edits create a new version and old versions are preserved for a period of time defined in the lifecycle policy.\nData objects are “marked for deletion” when deleted so that they are recoverable if needed within a period of time defined according to the data retention policy.\nData is archived offsite – i.e. to separate AWS account and/or region.\n\nAdditionally, all access to sensitive data is authenticated, and audited via logging of the infrastructure, systems and/or application."

    "text": "Whatever you do, it’s always beneficial to have the right tools at your disposal. I love working remotely and am a big advocate of doing remote software development. Therefore, I always strive to have the best equipment available to be as productive as possible. Writing posts like this constantly takes a lot of time. Luckily iVanky helped me out and sponsored this post so that I can concentrate on writing. I recently had the chance to test out one of their hottest products, a dual USB-C Docking Station that allows me to connect both my wide-screen monitors to my MacBook with Dual 4K@60Hz display connectivity. It also supports up to 96W laptop charging, which is awesome. If you are in a situation like me and want to upgrade your equipment, check out this and their other products! And now comes the article:\nWhether you are new to programming or already an experienced developer. In this industry, learning new concepts and languages/frameworks is mandatory to keep up with the rapid changes. Take for example React - open-sourced by Facebook just a shy 4 years ago it already became the number one choice for JavaScript devs around the globe. But also Vue and Angular, of course, have their legitimate follower-base. And then there is Svelte, and universal frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and Gatsby, and Gridsome, and Quasar, and and and. If you want to shine as an expert JavaScript developer you should at least have some experience in different frameworks and libraries - besides doing your homework with good, old JS.\nTo help you become Frontend Masters, I have collected 9 different projects, each with a distinct topic and a different JavaScript framework or library as a tech stack that you can build and add to your portfolio. Remember, nothing helps you more than actually building stuff so go ahead, sharpen your mind and make this happen!\n\nProject 1: Build a Weather App with React\nCreate a weather application using React. Utilize APIs to fetch real-time weather data and display it in a user-friendly interface. This project will help you understand React’s component-based architecture and API integration.\n\n\nProject 2: Create a E-commerce Website with Vue.js\nDevelop an e-commerce website using Vue.js. Learn about Vue’s reactivity system, component composition, and routing capabilities. Implement features such as product listings, shopping carts, and checkout processes to simulate a real-world online store.\n\n\nProject 3: Build a Blogging Platform with Angular\nConstruct a blogging platform using Angular. Explore Angular’s comprehensive framework and its powerful features like dependency injection and reactive forms. Implement CRUD operations for blog posts, user authentication, and user roles in this project.\n\n\nProject 4: Develop a Todo App with Svelte\nBuild a simple yet functional todo application using Svelte. Experience the benefits of Svelte’s reactive nature and fine-grained reactivity. Create features such as adding tasks, marking them as complete, and filtering out completed tasks.\n\n\nProject 5: Create a Real-Time Chat Application with Next.js\nConstruct a real-time chat application using Next.js. Leverage Next.js’s server-side rendering capabilities and built-in API routes to create a seamless chatting experience. Implement features like user authentication, real-time messaging, and message history.\n\n\nProject 6: Design a Portfolio Website with Nuxt.js\nDevelop a personal portfolio website using Nuxt.js. Explore Nuxt.js’s server-side rendering and static site generation features to build a performant and SEO-friendly portfolio. Showcase your projects, skills, and achievements with elegant design and smooth transitions.\n\n\nProject 7: Build a Blog with Gatsby\nCreate a blog using Gatsby, a powerful static site generator. Utilize Gatsby’s GraphQL-based data querying and pre-rendering capabilities to create a fast and optimized blog. Customize the layout, implement SEO features, and add Markdown support for creating blog posts.\n\n\nProject 8: Construct a Note-Taking App with Gridsome\nDevelop a note-taking application using Gridsome, a static site generator based on Vue.js. Create a fast and responsive app with Gridsome’s inherent optimizations and Vue.js’s reactive data handling. Implement features like creating, editing, and organizing notes.\n\n\nProject 9: Design a Multiplatform App with Quasar\nCreate a multiplatform application using Quasar, a framework based on Vue.js. Develop the same app for different platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile, while writing code only once. Learn about features like responsive design, cross-platform compatibility, and native app-like experiences.\nBy completing these projects, you’ll cover a wide range of frontend development concepts and gain hands-on experience with various frameworks and libraries. Remember, practice and building real-world projects are the key to becoming a frontend master.\n\n\nConclusion\nBecoming a frontend master requires continuous learning and hands-on experience with different frameworks and libraries. By taking on diverse projects and expanding your knowledge, you’ll be equipped to tackle new challenges and stay ahead in this rapidly evolving industry.\nRemember to always stay curious, explore new technologies, and never stop building. Good luck on your journey to becoming a frontend master!\nDisclaimer: This post is sponsored by iVanky.

For network and infrastructure service providers that support production and/or critical operations at CloudCore, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is defined and included in the service contract.\nAs appropriate, the executed agreement(s) are linked or attached to the vendor on the approved vendors list.\n\n\nMonitoring Vendor Risks\nVendor contracts are reviewed either annually or according to the signed contract duration.\nBased on the risk level and the sensitivity/criticality of data the vendor has access to, the vendor review may include an updated risk analysis performed by the security team in addition to legal and business review of contract terms.\nIf the vendor is a service provider, the DevOps team monitors the service status of the provider according to its SLA. This is done by either manually reviewing the posted service status on the vendor’s status pages at least quarterly, or by setting up alarms for service interruption using automation.\n\n\nSoftware and Systems Acquisition Process\nCloudCore Security maintains a list of pre-approved business software and a list of approved vendors / contractors.\nIf additional commercial software, hardware system, or cloud services is needed, a request should be submitted through CloudCore internal service desk. This will trigger the approval by manager/security and procurement process.\nAs applicable, CloudCore security team may conduct a risk analysis on the software or system to ensure it complies with CloudCore security, compliance and legal requirements and does not interfere with the security controls. If a risk is identified, additional controls should be identified and implemented (or planned) prior to acquisition. An alternative product may be considered as a result of the risk analysis."

    "section": "Controls and Procedures",
    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nConfiguration Management Processes\n\nConfiguration management is automated using industry-recognised tools like Chef, Salt and Terraform to enforce secure configuration standards.\nAll changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are reviewed and approved by Security team before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security requirements.\nAll changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.\nImplementation of approved changes are only performed by authorised personnel.\nTooling is used to generate an up to date system inventory.\n\nAll systems are categorised and labeled by their corresponding environment, such as dev, test, and prod.\nAll systems are classified and labeled based on the data they store or process, according to CloudCore data classification model.\nThe Security team maintains automation which monitors all changes to IT assets, generates inventory lists, using automatic IT assets discovery, and services provided by each cloud provider.\nIT assets database is used to generate the diagrams and asset lists required by the Risk Assessment phase of CloudCore’s Risk Management procedures\nCloudCore Change Management process ensures that all asset inventory created by automation is reconciled against real changes to production systems. This process includes periodic manual audits and approvals.\nDuring each change implementation, the change is reviewed and verified by the target asset owner as needed.\n\nCloudCore uses the Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) published by the Defence Information Systems Agency as a baseline for hardening systems.\n\nWindows-based systems use a baseline Active Directory group policy configuration in conjunction with the DISA STIGs.\nLinux-based systems use Red Hat Enterprise Linux STIG as a guideline for implementation.\nEC2 instances in AWS are provisioned using only hardened and approved Amason Machine Images (AMIs).\nDocker containers are launched using only approved Docker images that have been through security testing.\n\nAll IT assets in CloudCore have time synchronised to a single authoritative source.\n\nOn-premise systems are configured to point to an internal NTP server.\nThe internal NTP server and all AWS instances are pointing to the same set of ntp.org servers.\n\nAll frontend functionality (e.g. user dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (e.g. database and app servers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.\nAll software and systems are required to complete full-scale testing before being promoted to production.\nAll code changes are reviewed to assure software code quality, while in development, to proactively detect potential security issues using pull-requests and static code analysis tools. More details can be found in the Software Release / Code Promotion section.\n\n\n\nConfiguration Monitoring and Auditing\nAll infrastructure and system configurations, including all software-defined sources, are centrally aggregated to a configuration management database (CMDB) – JupiterOne.\nConfiguration auditing rules are created according to established baseline, approved configuration standards and control policies. Deviations, misconfigurations, or configuration drifts are detected by these rules and alerted to the security team.\n\n\nProduction Systems Provisioning\n\nBefore provisioning any systems, a request must be created and approved in the Production Change Management (PRODCM) project.\n\naccess requires authenticated users.\nSecurity grants access to the PRODCM project following the procedures covered in the Access Establishment and Modification section.\n\nThe security team must approve the provisioning request before any new system can be provisioned, unless a pre-approved automation process is followed.\nOnce provisioning has been approved, the implementer must configure the new system according to the standard baseline chosen for the system’s role.\nIf the system will be used to store sensitive information, the implementer must ensure the volume containing this sensitive data is encrypted.\nSensitive data in motion must always be encrypted.\nA security analysis is conducted once the system has been provisioned. This can be achieved either via automated configuration/vulnerability scans or manual inspection by the security team. Verifications include, but is not limited to:\n\nRemoval of default users used during provisioning.\nNetwork configuration for system.\nData volume encryption settings.\nIntrusion detection and virus scanning software installed.\n\nThe new system is fully promoted into production upon successful verification against corresponding CloudCore standards and change request approvals.\n\n\n\nUser Endpoint Security Controls and Configuration\n\nEmployee laptops, including Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, are configured either\n\nManually by IT or the device owner; or\nAutomatically using a configuration management tool or equivalent scripts.\n\nThe following security controls are applied at the minimum:\n\nDisk encryption\nUnique user accounts and strong passwords\nApproved NTP servers\nApproved security agents\nLocking after 2 mins of inactivity\nAuto-update of security patches\n\nThe security configurations on all end-user systems are inspected by Security through either a manual periodic review or an automated compliance auditing tool.\n\n\n\nServer Hardening Guidelines and Processes\n\nLinux System Hardening: Linux systems have their baseline security configuration applied via automation tools. These tools cover:\n\nEnsuring that the machine is up-to-date with security patches and is configured to apply patches in accordance with our policies.\nStopping and disabling any unnecessary OS services.\nApply applicable DISA STIGs to OS and applications.\nConfiguring 15-minute session inactivity timeouts for SSH sessions.\nInstalling and configuring the virus scanner.\nInstalling and configuring the NTP daemon, including ensuring that modifying system time cannot be performed by unprivileged users.\nConfiguring disk volumes for providers that do not have native support for encrypted data volumes, including ensuring that encryption keys are protected from unauthorised access.\nConfiguring authentication to the centralised Directory Services servers.\nConfiguring audit logging as described in the Auditing Policy section.\n\nWindows System Hardening: Windows systems have their baseline security configuration applied via the combination of Group Policy settings and/or automation scripts. These baseline settings cover:\n\nJoining the Windows Domain Controller and applying the Active Directory Group Policy configuration (for AD-managed systems only).\nEnsuring that the machine is up-to-date with security patches and is configured to apply patches in accordance with our policies.\nApply applicable DISA STIGs to OS and applications.\nStopping and disabling any unnecessary OS services.\nConfiguring session inactivity timeouts.\nInstalling and configuring security protection agents such as anti-virus scanner.\nConfiguring transport encryption according to the requirements described in the Mobile Device Security and Disposable Media Management section.\nConfiguring the system clock to point to approved NTP servers and ensuring that modifying system time cannot be performed by unprivileged users.\nConfiguring audit logging as described in the Auditing Policy section.\n\nAny additional configuration changes applied to hardened Windows systems must be clearly documented by the implementer and reviewed by the Security team.\n\n\n\nConfiguration and Provisioning of Management Systems\n\nProvisioning management systems such as configuration management servers, remote access infrastructure, directory services, or monitoring systems follows the same procedure as provisioning a production system.\nCritical infrastructure roles applied to new systems must be clearly documented by the implementer in the change request.\n\n\n\nConfiguration and Management of Network Controls\nAll network devices and controls on a sensitive network are configured such that:\n\nVendor provided default configurations are modified securely, including\n\ndefault encryption keys,\ndefault SNMP community strings, if applicable,\ndefault passwords/passphrases, and\nother security-related vendor defaults, if applicable.\n\nEncryption keys and passwords are changed anytime anyone with knowledge of the keys or passwords leaves the company or changes positions.\nTraffic filtering (e.g. firewall rules) and inspection (e.g. Network IDS/IPS or AWS VPC flow logs) are enabled.\nAn up-to-date network diagram is maintained.\n\nIn AWS, network controls are implemented using Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and Security Groups. The configurations are managed as code and stored in approved repos. All changes to the configuration follow the defined code review, change management and production deployment approval process.\n\n\nProvisioning AWS Accounts\n\nAWS Account Structure / Organisation\nCloudCore maintains a single Organisation in AWS, maintained in a top-level AWS account (master). Sub-accounts are connected that each hosts separate workloads and resources in its own sandboxed environment. The master account itself handles aggregated billing for all connected sub-accounts but does not host any workload, service or resource, with the exception of DNS records for CloudCore root domain, using AWS Route53 service. DNS records for subdomains are maintained in the corresponding sub-accounts.\nAccess to each account is funneled through our designated SSO provider, which establishes a trust relationship to a set of predefined roles in the master account. Once authenticated, a user then leverages AWS IAM Assume Role capability to switch to a sub-account to access services and resources.\nThe account and network structure looks like the following:\nSSO/IdP ── CloudCore-master\n            │  └── billing and root DNS records only\n            │\n            ├── CloudCore-dev\n            │    └── VPC\n            │        └── Subnets\n            │             └── Security-Groups\n            │                  └── EC2 instances\n            │                       └── Docker containers\n            │            \n            ├── CloudCore-test\n            │    └── VPC\n            │         └── Subnets\n            │              └── Security-Groups\n            │                   └── EC2 instances\n            │                        └── Docker containers\n            │\n            ├── CloudCore-infra\n            │    └── VPC\n            │         └── Subnets\n            │              └── Security-Groups\n            │                   └── EC2 instances\n            │                        └── Docker containers\n            │\n            ├── CloudCore-prod-us1\n            │    └── VPC\n            │         └── Subnets\n            │              └── Security-Groups\n            │                   └── EC2 instances\n            │                        └── Docker containers\n            │\n            ├── CloudCore-prod-us2\n            │\n            ...\n\n\nInfrastructure-as-Code\nCloudCore AWS environments and infrastructure are managed as code. Provisioning is accomplished using a set of automation scripts and Terraform code. Each new environment is created as a sub-account connected to CloudCore-master. The creation and provisioning of a new account follows the instructions documented in the Bootstrap a new AWS environment page of the development wiki.\n\n\n\nAutomated change management for deploys to AWS\nThe CloudCore Continuous Delivery Pipeline automates creation and validation of change requests. This is done in a 3-step process:\n\nCreate/Validate Change Request Ticket\nis used for continuous delivery (build and deploy), and we employ\n\nautomation such that:\nWhenever deployment to a controlled environment (e.g. production accounts and infrastructure account) is requested, the job will check for an approved PRODCM ticket, or create a new ticket if not found.\nThe automation code will attempt to automatically populate the required data for the PRODCM ticket (see list above).\nIf the data cannot be automatically populated, may pause the job and prompt the user for manual input.\nJob will be paused until the request is approved or canceled (rejected). Before continuing to deployment, will validate the change request’s build job identifier, build number and source code branch.\n\nDetect Change Details and Obtain Approval\nA separate change-management-bot is implemented to provide additional details to assist/automate the ticket approval process:\n\nWhenever a PRODCM ticket is created, the bot is triggered via a webhook.\nThe bot is configured to examine the following:\n\nLook for all the code changes since the last approved PRODCM ticket.\nCheck that all code commits have been approved by a reviewer other than the author, except for a version bump.\nEnsure that security scanning has been completed for this build and no blocking issue is found.\n\n!!! attention\n  The following practices will fail this validation and result in\n  manual processing, therefore should be avoided:\n\n  - squashing commits on PR merges\n  - commits after PR approval without re-approval\nDetails of the analysis are posted to the PRODCM ticket.\nWhen all the required checks pass validation, the bot recommends approval. The cm-bot may be configured to automatically approve the ticket if all of the required conditions above (and future ones) are met. Additionally, a manual review / approval is always required in the following conditions:\n\nThis is the first prod deploy with no prior approval history\nA related CM ticket / deploy of the same project is pending\n\nIf human approvals are needed, the required approvers will review the details and approve/decline accordingly.\nRandom inspections of automatically approved tickets are performed by the security team monthly to ensure the automation functions properly.\n\n!!! important\n1. Note that the above flow does not catch weaknesses in design, and\ntherefore does not replace the need for threat modeling and security\nreview in the design phase.\n2. Additional requirements may be added later as the process continues\nto mature.\nDetect Risky Changes, Deploy and Close\njob proceeds only with an approved and validated PRODCM ticket.\n\nDuring production deploys, a terraform plan is always performed first to detect risky changes.\nExamples of security-related or risky changes include:\n\nChange to “policy” attribute of resource (aws_s3_bucket.policy, aws_kms_key.policy)\nChange to IAM policy, role, user or group\nAttach/detach policy\nChange/delete to security group\nAnything is deleted (in prod, deletes should be unusual so they should be manually reviewed)\n\nIf risky changes are detected, the deploy is paused and the PRODCM ticket is updated to require manual review before continuing.\nOnce a deploy is completed, the PRODCM ticket is automatically resolved and closed.\n\n\n\n\nPatch Management Procedures\nLocal Systems\nCloudCore uses automated tooling to ensure systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n\nOn local Linux and Windows systems, the unattended-upgrades tool is used to apply security patches in phases.\n\nHigh Risk security patches are automatically applied as they are released\nMonthly system patching for regular applications are applied as needed.\nSnapshotting of a system will take place before an update is applied.\nOnce the update is deemed stable the snapshot will be removed.\nIn case of failure of the update the snapshot will be rolled back.\nIf the staging systems function properly after the two-week testing period, the security team will promote that snapshot into the mirror used by all production systems. These patches will be applied to all production systems during the next nightly patch run.\nThe patching process may be expedited by the Security team\nOn Windows systems, the baseline Group Policy setting configures Windows Update to implement the patching policy.\n\n\nCloud Resources\nCloudCore follows a “cattle-vs-pets” methodology to keep the resources in the cloud environments immutable and up-to-date with security patches.\n\nAWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) is used to dynamically manage container resources based on demand.\nEngineering team builds security-approved AMI from the latest AWS optimised Amason Machine Image (AMI) to include required security agent.\nThe security agents installed on the security-approved AMIs continuously scan for and report new vulnerabilities.\nThe custom AMIs are automatically rebuilt from the latest AWS AMIs weekly to include the latest security patches.\n\nUser Endpoints\nCloudCore requires auto-update for security patches to be enabled for all user endpoints, including laptops and workstations.\n\nThe auto-update configuration and update status on all end-user systems are inspected by Security through either manual periodic audits or automated compliance auditing agents installed on the endpoints.\n\n\n\nProduction Deploy / Code Promotion Processes\nIn order to promote changes into Production, a valid and approved Change Request (CR) is required. It can be created in the Change Management System/Portal which implements the CloudCore Change Management workflow, using the Production Change Management (PRODCM) project to manage changes and approvals.\n\nAt least two approvals are required for each PRODCM ticket. By default, the approvers are\n\nSecurity Lead and\nEngineering Lead.\n\nAdditional approver(s) may be added depending on the impacted component(s). For example,\n\nthe IT Manager is added as an approver for IT/network changes; and\nthe DevOps Lead is added as an approver for changes to aws-CloudCore-infra account in AWS.\n\nEach PRODCM ticket requires the following information at a minimum:\n\nSummary of the change\nComponent(s) impacted\nJustification\nRollback plan\n\nAdditional details are required for a code deploy, including:\n\nBuild job name\nBuild ID and/or number\nDeploy action (e.g. plan, apply)\nDeploy branch (e.g. master)\nTarget environment (e.g. aws-CloudCore-infra, aws-CloudCore-prod-us, datacenter-hq)\nLinks to pull requests and/or issues\nSecurity scan status and results\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Change\nIn the event of an emergency, the person or team on call is notified. This may include a combination or Development, IT, and Security.\nIf an emergency change must be made, such as patching of a zero-day security vulnerability or recovering from a system downtime, and that the standard change management process cannot be followed due to time constraint or personnel availability or other unforeseen issues, the change can be made by:\n\nNotification: The Engineering Lead, Security Lead, and/or IT Lead must be notified by email, Slack, or phone call prior to the change . Depending on the nature of the emergency, the leads may choose to inform members of the executive team.\nAccess and Execution: Manually access of the production system or manual deploy of software, using one of the following access mechanisms as defined in Access Control policy and procedures:\n\nSupport/Troubleshooting access\nRoot account or root user access\nLocal system access (for on-premise environment)\n\nPost-emergency Documentation: A PRODCM ticket should be created within 24 hours following the emergency change. The ticket should contains all details related to the change, including:\n\nReason for emergency change\nMethod of emergency access used\nSteps and details of the change that was made\nSign-off/approvals must be obtained per the type of change as defined by the standard CM process\n\nPrevention and Improvement: The change must be fully reviewed by Security and Engineering together with the person/team responsible for the change. Any process improvement and/or preventative measures should be documented and an implementation plan should be developed."

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nTypes of System Audits\nCloudCore’s auditing processes include the following.\n\nConfiguration and Activity Monitoring: This refers to the logging, monitoring, scanning and alerting of a system, account, or environment, which may be achieved using real-time automated scripts/software or a manual review/testing. This type of auditing is performed continuously as part of CloudCore operations.\n!!! tip “Examples include:”\n * User: User and account-level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.\n * Application: Application-level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.\n * System: System-level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, file integrity, and other system-defined specific actions.\n * Network: Network-level scans or audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, perform penetrations, and identify vulnerabilities.\n * Traffic: Traffic refers to the incoming and outgoing traffic into and out of production/restricted environments. For example, firewall logs or VPC flow logs in AWS.\n * Data: Data includes all successful and failed attempts at production data access and editing.\n\n *Data associated with above events will include origin, destination, action performed, timestamp, and other relevant details available.*\nAccess Review: This refers to the review of all user and service accounts and permissions across CloudCore operational environments, including on-premise systems, cloud environments such as AWS accounts, and other applications such as collaboration software, ticketing system and code repos.\n\nCloudCore developed an internal tool to automatically pull configurations from our cloud based environments, including\n\nAWS access configuration from IAM policies, EC2 VPC and security group settings, S3 bucket policies, Lambda and API Gateway resources, etc.;\nUsers, groups, application access from Okta IdP;\nNetwork access settings from Cisco Meraki, etc.\n\nThe data is collected either on demand triggered by security team or by changes in the operational environment.\nThe data is used by the tool to aggregate and analyse user and application access.\nAccess to other systems and applications that are not covered by this automated tool are reviewed manually on a quarterly basis or with any significant change to the target environment.\nAs a result of each review, unused or invalid access will be removed.\n\nCompliance and Controls Audit: This refers to the audit performed against the Technical, Administrative, and/or Physical controls as defined in CloudCore policies and procedures, to measure their adoption and effectiveness. This type of auditing is typically performed by either a designated internal audit team or an external audit firm, at defined intervals or prompted by a trigger event.\n!!! tip “Potential trigger events include:”\n * Scheduled compliance audit/assessment (e.g. annual risk assessment)\n * High risk or problem prone incidents or events, or as part of post-incident activities\n * Business associate, customer, or partner complaints\n * Identification of significant security vulnerabilities\n * Atypical patterns of activity\n * Failed authentication attempts\n * Remote access use and activity\n * Activity post termination\n * Random audits\n\n\n\nSecurity Events Analysis\nSecurity logs, events, and audit trails are reviewed by the security team with the assistance of automated systems and processes.\n\nAuditing logs are automatically analysed and correlated by the monitoring solutions and/or a centralised security information and event management system.\nThe systems are configured with rules/policies to identify suspicious activities, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.\n\nAlerts are triggered upon identification of an issue based on the policy configuration.\n\nThe alerts are sent immediately to the responsible staff (e.g. security team) for analysis. The alerts may be sent via email, Slack messaging, or as notification on the monitoring dashboard.\nAnalysis is prioritised based on alert severity. High severity alerts are typically reviewed within 24 hours.\nIncident response process is followed, as needed.\nPatches and updates will be applied to all systems in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nInternal/Manual Auditing Activities\nAdditional manual reviews, such as user accounts and access auditing, may be necessary from time to time. These activities may be triggered by the events listed above.\n\nResponsibility for audit activity is assigned to CloudCore’s Security Officer. The Security Officer shall:\n\nAssign the task of generating reports for audit activities to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network;\nAssign the task of reviewing the audit reports to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network, the Privacy Officer, or any other individual determined to be appropriate for the task;\nOrganise and provide oversight to a team structure charged with audit compliance activities (e.g., parameters, frequency, sample sises, report formats, evaluation, follow-up, etc.).\nAll connections to CloudCore are monitored. Access is limited to certain services, ports, and destinations. Exceptions to these rules, if created, are reviewed on an annual basis.\n\nThe manual review process shall define and include:\n\nDescription of the activity as well as rationale for performing the audit.\nIdentification of personnel to perform the review (workforce members shall not review audit logs that pertain to their own system activity).\nFrequency of the auditing process.\nDetermination of significant events requiring further review and follow-up.\nIdentification of appropriate reporting channels for audit results and required follow-up.\n\nManual audits and reviews activities are tracked in .\nAuditing, reviews and testing may be carried out internally or provided through an external third-party vendor. Whenever possible, a third party auditing vendor should not be providing the organisation IT oversight services (e.g., vendors providing IT services should not be auditing their own services to ensure separation of duties).\n\n\n\nAudit Requests\n\nA request may be made for an audit for a specific cause. The request may come from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, Privacy Officer, Security Officer, Customer, Partner, or an Application owner or application user.\nA request for an audit for specific cause must include time frame, frequency, and nature of the request.\nA request for an audit must be reviewed and approved by CloudCore’s Privacy Officer and/or Security Officer before proceeding. Under no circumstances shall detailed audit information be shared with parties without proper permissions and access to see such data.\n\nShould the audit disclose that a workforce member has accessed sensitive data inappropriately, the minimum necessary/least privileged information shall be shared with CloudCore’s Security Officer to determine appropriate sanction/corrective disciplinary action.\nOnly de-identified information shall be shared with Customer or Partner regarding the results of the investigative audit process. This information will be communicated to the appropriate personnel by CloudCore’s Privacy Officer or designee. Prior to communicating with customers and partners regarding an audit, it is recommended that CloudCore consider seeking guidance from risk management and/or legal counsel.\n\n\n\n\nReview and Reporting of Audit Findings\n\nAudit information that is routinely gathered must be reviewed in a timely manner, at least monthly, by the responsible workforce member(s). Additional reviews are performed as needed to assure the proper data is being captured and retained.\nThe reporting process shall allow for meaningful communication of the audit findings to relevant workforce members, Customers, or Partners.\n\nSignificant findings shall be reported immediately in a written format. CloudCore’s security incident response form may be utilised to report a single event.\nRoutine findings shall be reported to the sponsoring leadership structure in a written report format.\n\nReports of audit results shall be limited to internal use on a minimum necessary/need-to-know basis. Audit results shall not be disclosed externally without administrative and/or legal counsel approval.\nSecurity audits constitute an internal, confidential monitoring practice that may be included in CloudCore’s performance improvement activities and reporting. Care shall be taken to ensure that the results of the audits are disclosed to administrative-level oversight structures only and that information which may further expose organisational risk is shared with extreme caution. Generic security audit information may be included in organisational reports (individually-identifiable information shall not be included in the reports).\nWhenever indicated through evaluation and reporting, appropriate corrective actions must be undertaken. These actions shall be documented and shared with the responsible workforce members, Customers, and/or Partners.\n\n\n\nRemediation of Control Deficiencies\nMost controls are continuously monitored and reported via automation on the JupiterOne platform.\nControl deficiencies identified as a result of an internal or external system audit are documented and reviewed with management.\nSecurity team works with the corresponding control owner to prioritise and mitigate the control deficiency, including applying corrective actions, implementating additional controls or adjusting existing controls as needed.\n\n\nAudit Trails and Application Security Events Logging Standard\nCloudCore logging standards requires application and system logs to contain sufficient information to determine who did what, when, where to ensure recording of security and audit events and to generate evidence for unauthorised activities.\nAll systems and software developed at CloudCore must have the following security events logging enabled as part of or in addition to standard application logging.\n\nAll security log events must have the following attributes at minimum:\n\nTimestamp of the event (synchronised to approved time server)\nIdentifier of the principal performing the action (such as user ID)\nLocation including both origin (such as hostname/IP) and target (such as host/service/resource)\nActivity or action (such as log in, log out, create, read, update, delete of a resource)\n\nthe action may be logged as and determined by the HTTP request method and the API endpoint\n\nEvent description and additional details may be logged depending on the system or application\n\nThe following types of security events must be logged at minimum:\n\nUser and group administration activities (user or group added, updated, deleted, access granted/revoked)\nAll login attempts, successful and unsuccessful including the source IP address\nAll interactive logoffs\nPrivileged actions (configuration changes, application shutdown/restart, software update etc)\nMajor application events (e.g. application failure, start and restart, shutdown)\nAny and all actions performed on critical resources such as production data\n\nAll application and system logs must not include (removed or masked):\n\nAny sensitive information, including protected health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII)\n\nexcept for IP addresses\nusernames/logins may/should be logged as part of authentication logging\nfor user action auditing, opaque IDs should be used instead of usernames/logins whenever possible\n\nAuthentication and session tokens, user credentials\n\nSecurity events and audit logs must be:\n\nAlways accessible to the monitoring system/team\nProtected from any changes\nMonitored with alerting mechanism in place (including alert for not receiving log events for a certain period of time)\n\nAll CloudCore IT infrastructure must have system clock synchronised\n\nExamples of recommended application events for logging and their auditing purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nClient requests and server responses\nforensics and debugging - details level is defined by application\n\n\nSuccessful and unsuccessful login attempts\nauthentication\n\n\nSuccessful and failed access to application resources\nauthorisation, escalation of privileges\n\n\nExcessive amount of requests from the client\nbrute-forcing, malicious bots, denial of service attacks\n\n\nE-mails sent by an application\nspamming, social engineering\n\n\n\nDetails of the logging configuration is documented at\n\nApplication Logging - documented on the Engineering Wiki\nIdentity and Access Activity Logs via Okta\nAWS Cloudtrail\nAWS S3 Server Access Logs\n\n\n\nAudit Trail Integrity - Security Controls and Log Retention\n\nAudit logs shall be protected from unauthorised access or modification, so the information they contain will be made available only if needed to evaluate a security incident or for routine audit activities as outlined in this policy.\nAll audit logs are protected in transit and encrypted at rest to control access to the content of the logs.\nWhenever possible, audit logs shall be stored on a separate system to minimise the impact auditing may have on the privacy system and to prevent access to audit trails by those with system administrator privileges.\n\nSeparate systems are used to apply the security principle of “separation of duties” to protect audit trails from hackers.\nCloudCore logging servers may include Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) as part of their baseline configuration to ease reviewing of audit log data. The ELK toolkit provides message summarisation, reduction, and reporting functionality.\n\nReports summarising audit activities shall be retained for a period of seven years.\nAudit log data is retained locally on the audit log server or in the source environment for a period of one month. Beyond that, log data is encrypted and moved to warm storage (currently S3) using automated scripts, and is retained for a minimum of one year.\nRaw event data may be purged after one month / 30 days as long as the required details are sufficiently covered in aggregated audit logs/reports.\n\n\n\nAuditing Customer and Partner Activity\n\nPeriodic monitoring of Customer and Partner activity shall be carried out to ensure that access and activity is appropriate for privileges granted and necessary to the arrangement between CloudCore and the 3rd party. CloudCore will make every effort to assure Customers and Partners do not gain access to data outside of their own environments.\nIf it is determined that the Customer or Partner has exceeded the scope of access privileges, CloudCore’s management and security must remedy the problem immediately.\nIf it is determined that a Customer or Partner has violated the terms of the HIPAA business associate agreement or any terms within the HIPAA regulations, CloudCore must take immediate action to remediate the situation. Continued violations may result in discontinuation of the business relationship.\n\n\n\nAuditing and Assessment Tools\nCloudCore’s Security Officer is authorised to select and use assessment tools that are designed to detect vulnerabilities and intrusions. Use of such tools against CloudCore systems and environments are prohibited by others, including Customers and Partners, without the explicit authorisation of the Security Officer. These tools may include, but are not limited to:\n\nScanning tools and devices;\nPassword cracking utilities;\nNetwork “sniffers”;\nSecurity agents installed locally on servers and endpoints;\nPassive and active intrusion detection systems; and\nPenetration testing tools.\n\nVulnerability testing software may be used to probe the network to identify what is running (e.g., operating system or product versions in place), whether publicly-known vulnerabilities have been corrected, and evaluate whether the system can withstand attacks aimed at circumventing security controls.\n\n\nTraining, Education, Awareness and Responsibilities\n\nCloudCore workforce members are provided training, education, and awareness on safeguarding the privacy and security of business and data. CloudCore’s commitment to auditing access and activity of the information applications, systems, and networks is communicated through new employee orientation, ongoing training opportunities and events, and applicable policies. CloudCore workforce members are made aware of responsibilities with regard to privacy and security of information as well as applicable sanctions/corrective disciplinary actions should the auditing process detect a workforce member’s failure to comply with organisational policies.\nCloudCore Customers are provided with necessary information to understand CloudCore auditing capabilities. Platform Customers are responsible for the logging, auditing and retention of any application hosted outside of CloudCore environments, even though the applications may integrate with CloudCore Platform API. Customer applications hosted within the CloudCore environments will follow the auditing standards and procedures defined in this document."

This may include\n\nSecure wipe;\nPhysical destruction;\nDestruction of encryption keys (if the data on the media is encrypted using a strong algorithm such as AES-256).\n\nIf the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to ensure that the records are returned to the organisation or properly destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.\nAll CloudCore Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract, they will return or destroy/dispose of all patient health information. In cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent its return or destruction/disposal.\nIn the cases of a CloudCore Customer terminating a contract with CloudCore and no longer utilise CloudCore Services, data will be returned or disposed per contract agreement or CloudCore Platform use terms and conditions. In all cases it is solely the responsibility of the CloudCore Customer to maintain the safeguards required of laws and regulations once the data is transmitted out of CloudCore environments.\n\n\n\nUse of USB Flash Drive and External Storage Device\nPer CloudCore corporate policy, confidential and critical data may not be stored on external devices such as USB flash drives. This includes and is not limited to ePHI. For definition of confidential and critical data, see CloudCore Data Classification and Handling Policy.\nUsage of USB flash drives for temporary transfer of confidential and critical data may be allowed on a case by case basis, when the following process is followed:\n\nData is only allowed on encrypted flash devices approved by CloudCore Security and the IT Manager (currently IronKey).\nThe process starts with the submission of a ticket in . The ticket must be approved by IT and Security.\nUpon completion of data transfer all sensitive data on the device must be completely removed.\nThe device is to be returned to the IT Manager to double check that the data has been removed.\nThe IT Manager will check the drive back in.\n\n\n\nSupport and Management of BYOD Devices\nCloudCore provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.\nCloudCore currently does not require or support employees bringing their own computing devices.\nThe end-user computing devices are self managed. Each CloudCore employee is responsible to\n\nconfigure their laptop/workstation to meeting the configuration and management requirements; and\nensure the latest security patches are installed or auto-update is enabled.\n\nIT and Security provides automated scripts for end-user system configurations and/or technical assistance as needed. Such configurations are audited daily using Jamf centrally managed by the Security team."

NDA is usually required but may be waived on a case-by-case basis.\nExample Internal Data Types includes\n\nInternal documentation\nPolicies and procedures\nProduct roadmaps\nMost source codes\n\nPublic data is Information intended for public consumption. Although non-confidential, the integrity and availability of public data should be protected.\nExample Internal Data Types includes\n\nNews and public announcements (post-announcement)\nMarketing materials\nProduct documentation\nContents posted on company website(s) and social media channel(s)\n\n\n\n\nData Handling Requirements Matrix\nRequirements for data handling, such as the need for encryption and the duration of retention, are defined according to the CloudCore Data Classifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nLabeling or Tagging\nSegregated Storage\nEndpoint Storage\nEncrypt At Rest\nEncrypt In Transit\nEncrypt In Use\nControlled Access\nMonitoring\nDestruction at Disposal\nRetention Period\nBackup Recovery\n\n\n\n\nCritical\nRequired\nRequired\nProhibited\nRequired\nRequired\nRequired\nAccess is blocked to end users by default; Temporary access for privileged users only\nRequired\nRequired\n7 years for audit trails; Varies for customer-owned data†\nRequired\n\n\nConfidential\nRequired\nN/R\nAllowed\nRequired\nRequired\nRequired\nAll access is based on need-to-know\nRequired\nRequired\n7 years for official documentation; Others vary based on business need\nRequired\n\n\nInternal\nRequired\nN/R\nAllowed\nN/R\nN/R\nN/R\nAll employees and contractors (read); Data owners and authorised individuals (write)\nN/R\nN/R\n7 years for official documentation; Others vary based on business need\nOptional\n\n\nPublic\nN/R\nN/R\nAllowed\nN/R\nN/R\nN/R\nEveryone (read); Data owners and authorised individuals (write)\nN/R\nN/R\nVaries based on business need\nOptional\n\n\n\nN/R = Not Required\n† customer-owned data is stored for as long as they remain as a CloudCore customer, or as required by regulations, whichever is longer. Customer may request their data to be deleted at any time; unless retention is required by law.\n\n\nData Inventory and Lifecycle Management\nCloudCore Security team uses an automated system to query across our cloud-based infrastructure, including but is not limited to AWS, to obtain detailed records of all data repositories, including but not limited to:\n\nAWS S3 repositories\nAWS RDS and DynamoDB instances\nAWS EC2 volumes\nSource code repositories\nOffice 365\nOn-premise storage systems (manually maintained)\n\nThe records are stored in a database system maintained by CloudCore security team. Records are tagged with owner/project and classification when applicable. All records are kept up to date via automation. The system is also designed to track movement of data and update/alert accordingly.\nAWS S3 Object Lifecycle Management\nThe CloudCore platform will automatically adjust the storage class for certain types of data based on its usage pattern and age. This allows the CloudCore platform to provide competitive pricing while still allowing the customer to store large amounts of data.\nAWS provides the following storage classes:\n\nGeneral Purpose\nInfrequent Access\nArchive (Amason Glacier)\n\nS3 lifecycle policies are used to manage the storage class for certain types of data. In most cases, the CloudCore platform automatically adjusts the storage class but we may give customers the ability to adjust the storage class manually to meet their pricing or performance needs.\nCloudCore performs regular full backups of all production data. We leverage S3 lifecycle policies to automatically remove old backup data. This allows older data to “age out” instead of having to explicitly delete it. S3 lifecycle policies are also used to adjust the storage class of data backups based on the age of the backup.\nOther Business Data\nAll internal and confidential business records and documents, such as product plans, business strategies, presentations and reports, are stored outside of an employee workstation or laptop.\n\nOfficial records are stored in record management systems such as\n\n(tickets),\n(source code),\n(HR),\n(expense reports), etc.\n\nUnstructured business documents such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations are stored on CloudCore internal file share.\nConfidential business documents/records are be stored in encrypted form and with access control enabled on a need-to-know basis.\n\nTransient Data Managemet\nData may be temporarily stored by a system for processing. For example, a storage device may be used to stage temp/raw files prior to being uploaded to the production environment in AWS. These transient data repositories are not intended for long term storage, and data is purged immediately after use.\nCloudCore currently does NOT use transient storage for any sensitive data.\n\n\nBackup and Recovery\n\nCustomer Data\nCloudCore stores data in a secure production account in AWS, using a combination of S3, DynamoDB, and Aurora SQL databases. By default, Amason S3 provides durable infrastructure to store important data and is designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects.\nAll data store services and platforms in use are HIPAA compliant.\nCloudCore performs automatic backup of all customer and system data to protect against catastrophic loss due to unforeseen events that impact the entire system. An automated process will back up all data to a separate AWS region in the same country (e.g. US East to US West). By default, data will be backed up daily. The backups are encrypted in the same way as live production data.\nCustomers can also utilise the CloudCore Application Programming Interface (API) to extract and store their data elsewhere. Standard API usage fees will apply.\n\n\nSource code\nCloudCore stores its source in git repositories hosted by .\nSource code repositories are backed up to CloudCore’s AWS S3 infrastructure account on a weekly basis with a common set of configuration for each repository to enforce SDLC processes.\nIn the event that suffers a catastrophic loss of data, source code will be restored from the backups in AWS S3.\nBecause AWS and can both host git repositories, we are able to leverage git’s ability to maintain a full history of all changes to our git repos via the commit log.\n\n\nBusiness records and documents\nEach data owner/creator is responsible for maintaining a backup copy of their business files local on their laptop/workstation to the appropriate location on CloudCore SharePoint team site. Examples of business files include, but are not limited to:\n\nDocuments (e.g. product specs, business plans)\nPresentations\nReports and spreadsheets\nDesign files/images/diagrams\nMeeting notes/recordings\nImportant records (e.g. approval notes)\n\nUnless the local workstation/device has access to Critical data, backups of user workstations/devices are self managed by the device owner. Backups may be stored on an external hard drive or using a cloud service such as iCloud if and only if the data is both encrypted and password protected (passwords must meet CloudCore requirements).\n\n\n\nData Deletion Procedures\n\nFor Platform Customers\nDespite not being a requirement within HIPAA, CloudCore understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor/service provider, and at times a business associate, CloudCore is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state.\nCloudCore has created and implemented the following procedures to make it easier for CloudCore Customers to support data retention laws.\nSome types of customer data may be automatically transitioned to a storage class that is appropriate for archival or infrequent usage. The guidelines for transitioning data to different storage classes is at the discretion of CloudCore.\nCustomer data is retained for as long as the account is in active status. Data enters an expired state when the account is voluntarily closed. Expired account data will be retained for 14 days. After 14 days, the project/account and related data will be removed. Customers that wish to voluntarily close their account should download their data manually or via the API prior to closing their account.\nIf an account is involuntarily suspended, then there is a 14 day grace period during which the account will be inaccessible but can be re-opened if the customer meets their payment obligations and resolves any terms of service violations. If a customer wishes to manually backup their data in a suspended account, then they must ensure that their account is brought back to good standing so that the API and user interface will be available for their use. After 14 days, the suspended account will be closed and the data will be permanently removed (except when required by law to retain).\n\n\nFor patient data as as a Covered Entity\nCloudCore is NOT a covered entity. Should we become a covered entity in the future, we would be required by law to retain healthcare records for up to 10 years beyond when service was last provided when providing healthcare services directly to patients. Any patient data that is marked for deletion will be archived for the time required by law. This archived data can be retrieved by the customer as long as it is retrieved within 10 years from date of last service."

If a posting is needed to obtain technical support, data must be sanitised to remove any sensitive or confidential information prior to posting.\nAnti-malware or equivalent protection and monitoring must be installed and enabled on all endpoint systems that may be affected by malware, including workstations, laptops and servers.\nAll data storage devices and media must be managed according to the CloudCore Data Classification specifications and Data Handling procedures.\nIt is strictly forbidden to download or store any sensitive data on end-user computing devices, including laptops, workstations and mobile devices.\nMobile devices are not allowed to connect directly to CloudCore production environments.\n\n\n\nEmployee Screening Procedures\nCloudCore publishes job descriptions for available positions and conducts interviews to assess a candidates technical skills as well as culture fit prior to hiring.\nBackground checks of an employee or contractor is performed by HR/operations and/or the hiring team prior to the start date of employment.\n\n\nEmployee Onboarding Procedures\nA master checklist for employee onboarding is maintained by HR/Facilities.\nIt is published in the HR system or the HR folder on CloudCore’s internal file sharing site.\nThe HR Representative / Facility Manager is responsible to create an Issue in the HR & Facilities project to initiate and track the onboarding process. The onboarding process should include the following IT/Security items:\n\nTraining.\n\nNew workforce member is provided training on CloudCore security policy, acceptable use policy, and given access to the Employee Handbook.\nHIPAA awareness training is provided to new workforce member.\nRecords of training and policy acceptance is kept in the HR system (currently EaseCentral).\nThe training and acceptance must be completed within 30 days of employment.\n\nAccess.\n\nStandard access is provisioned according to the job role and approval as specified in the HR onboarding ticket.\nNon-standard access requires additional approval following the access request procedures.\nRequest for modifications of access for any CloudCore employee can be made using the procedures outlined in the Access Establishment and Modification policy and procedures.\n\nSystem configuration.\n\nThe end-user computing device (e.g. workstation or laptop) may be provisioned by IT to install necessary software, malware protection, security agents, and setting system configurations.\nUsers in a technical role, such as Development, may choose to self configure their system. In this case, the user is given configuration guidelines defined by IT and Security. The system must have the required security configuration and endpoint agents installed for monitoring and to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Exiting/Termination Procedures\nA master checklist for employee existing/termination is maintained by HR/Facilities. It is published in the HR system or the HR folder on CloudCore’s internal file sharing site.\n\nThe Human Resources Department (or other designated department), users, and their supervisors (HR) are required to notify Security upon completion and/or termination of access needs and facilitating completion of the “Termination Checklist”.\nHR are required to notify Security to terminate a user’s access rights if there is evidence or reason to believe the following (these incidents are also reported on an incident report and is filed with the Privacy Officer):\n\nThe user has been using their access rights inappropriately;\nA user’s password has been compromised (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the original password);\nAn unauthorised individual is utilising a user’s User Login ID and password (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as providing the unauthorised individual with the User Login ID and password).\n\nSecurity will terminate users’ access rights immediately upon notification, and will coordinate with the appropriate CloudCore employees to terminate access to any non-production systems managed by those employees.\nSecurity audits and may terminate access of users that have not logged into organisation’s information systems/applications for an extended period of time.\n\n\n\nEmployee Issue Escalation\nCloudCore workforce members are to escalate issues using the procedures outlined in the Employee Quick Reference. Issues that are brought to the Escalation Team are assigned an owner. The membership of the Escalation Team is maintained by the Chief Executive Officer or his delegate.\nSecurity incidents, particularly those involving sensitive data, are handled using the process described in Incident Response. If the incident involves a breach of sensitive data, the Security Officer will manage the incident using the process described in Breach Notification. Refer to Incident Response for a list of sample items that can trigger CloudCore’s incident response procedures; if you are unsure whether the issue is a security incident, contact the Security team immediately.\nIt is the duty of the incident owner to follow the process outlined below:\n\nCreate an Issue in the Security Project.\nThe Issue is investigated, documented, and, when a conclusion or remediation is reached, it is moved to Review.\nThe Issue is reviewed by another member of the Escalation Team. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further evaluation and review.\nIf the Issue is approved, it is marked as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.\nThe workforce member that initiated the process is notified of the outcome via email.\n\n\n\nWhistleblower Policy and Process\nThe CloudCore requires all workforce members to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. All workforce members must practice honesty and integrity in fulfilling their responsibilities and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nReporting Responsibility. Each workforce member is required and encouraged to report serious concerns so that CloudCore can address and correct inappropriate internal conduct and actions. This includes\n\n\nquestionable or improper accounting or auditing matters,\nviolations and suspected violations of company policies or ethics, or\nsuspected violations of law or regulations that govern CloudCore’s operations\n\n\nActing in Good Faith. Anyone filing a written complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.\nConfidentiality. Insofar as possible, the confidentiality of the whistleblower will be maintained. However, identity may have to be disclosed to conduct a thorough investigation, to comply with the law, and to provide accused individuals their legal rights of defence.\nNo Retaliation. Workforce members, in good faith, reporting a concern under the Whistleblower Policy shall NOT be subject to retaliation or adverse employment consequences. Moreover, any workforce member who retaliates against someone who has reported a concern in good faith is subject to disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment.\nReporting. Reports of concerns may be filed directly with the company CEO, COO, and/or the Compliance Officer. Additional reporting procedure details can be found in the employee handbook."

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nPolicy Management Process\n\nDocument Structure\nPolicies are written in individual documents, each pertaining to a specific domain of concern.\nEach document starts with the current version number in the format of YYYY.# (e.g. 2017.1), followed by a brief summary. The remaining of the document is structured to contain the following subsections:\n\nPolicy Statements\nApplicable Standards\nControls and Procedures\n\n\n\nVersioning\nEach CloudCore policy document contains a version and optionally a revision number. The version number is the four digit year followed by a number, to indicate the year and sequence number of the policy at which time it was written or updated.\nThe version number shall be incremented by one with each material change to the policy content. For example, if a new policy statement is added or a technical control/procedure is updated to 2017.1 version of a policy, the new version should be numbered 2017.2.\nThe policy document may also include a revision number, in the format of rev.#, immediately following the main version number. A revision number indicate minor, non-material changes to the document, such as formatting changes, fixing typos, or adding minor details.\n\n\nNumbering\nIf sequencing numbers are included in the policy headings:\n\nPolicy may be referenced by its statement number, such as §2.1(a), in internal/external communications as well as in other CloudCore policies or technical/business documentation for cross reference.\nAs such, to maintain cross referencing integrity, starting from version 2017.2, all numbering shall remain intact for policy documents and statements.\nWhen updating, avoid reordering and renumbering of policy documents and statements. For example:\n\nAppend at the end of the list by adding new statement(s) as needed instead of inserting.\nIf a policy or policy statement is no longer applicable, mark it deprecated instead of removing the file or statement completely.\n\n\n\n\nReview and Maintenance of Policies\n\nAll policies are stored and up to date to maintain CloudCore compliance with HIPAA,\nSOC 2 and other relevant standards. Updates and version control are done similar to source code control.\nPolicy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by the Security and Privacy Officer to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.\nCloudCore employees may request changes to policies using the following process:\n\nThe CloudCore employee initiates a policy change request by creating an Issue in the Security project. The change request may optionally include a pull request from a separate branch or repository containing the desired changes.\nThe Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the policy change request.\nOnce the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\nIf the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.\nIf the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorised personnel using CloudCore’s change management process.\nIf the change results in a new version instead of a new revision (see §3.3.1 for definitions), the current version of the policy document(s) must be saved to archive under the corresponding version number prior to the new policy being adopted/published and prior to merging the pull request containing the changes. This allows easy reference to previous versions if necessary.\n\n!!! important\n * Changes are made on the `drafts` (or equivalent) branch instead of on the `master` branch for commits.\n * If multiple authors are working on the changes, additional separate branches and pull requests may be necessary before changes are merged in `drafts`.\n * Changes must not be merged to `master` without the approval of Security and Privacy Officer.\n * Changes must not be merged to `master` without archiving the existing version of policy document(s), unless the change is a minor revision.\n * Once the changes are final and approved, a pull request shall be created from the `drafts` branch to the `master` branch and all members of the development team shall be included as approvers.  This serves as communication and training of policy updates to the development organisation, and the pull request approvals serve as records of training received.\n * Policy update communication and training for non-development staff is conducted separately by the Security team.\nAll policies are made accessible to all CloudCore workforce members. The current master policies are published at .\n\nChanges are automatically communicated to all CloudCore team members through integrations between and Slack that log changes to a predefined CloudCore Slack Channel.\nThe Security Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.\n\nAll policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 7 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later\n\nVersion history of all CloudCore policies is done via .\nBackup storage of all policies is done with AWS S3 and/or internal file share (e.g. Microsoft Office365 SharePoint or Box).\n\nThe policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to CloudCore’s organisational environment, by the security committee members. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by CloudCore management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:\n\nThe Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in the Security project or via a Pull Request (PR).\nThe Security Committee members and additional reviewers are notified by email or via the PR to review the current policies.\nIf changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented in the Issue/PR.\nOnce the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue/PR. If the Issue/PR is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\nIf the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, or merges the PR into master branch, adding any pertinent notes required.\nPolicy review is monitored using or reporting to assess compliance with above policy.\n\n\nAdditional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in Roles and Responsibilities."

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\n\nStandards for Access Provisioning\n\nWorkforce Clearance\n\nThe level of security assigned to a user to the organisation’s information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user’s job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.\nAll access requests are treated on a “least-privilege” principle.\nCloudCore maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, CloudCore, including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI.\n\n\n\nAccess Authorisation\n\nRole based access categories for each CloudCore system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer.\nCloudCore utilises hardware-defined and/or software-defined boundaries to segment data, prevent unauthorised access, and monitor traffic for denial of service attacks.\n\n\n\nPerson or Entity Authentication\n\nEach workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.\nEach Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password or OpenID Connect that identifies him/her as the user of the information system. This is enforced through the use of AWS Cognito.\nAll customer support interactions must be verified before CloudCore support personnel will satisfy any request having information security implications.\n\n\n\nUnique User Identification\n\nAccess to the CloudCore Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and developer.\nPasswords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).\nPasswords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.\nDefault accounts on all production systems and environments, including root, are disabled/locked.\nShared accounts are not allowed within CloudCore systems or networks.\n\n\n\nAutomatic Logon and Logoff\n\nAutomated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with CloudCore workstations or production systems.\n\nAutomatic log-on may only be permitted for low-risk systems such as conference room PCs connecting to a Zoom Room.\nSuch systems are configured on separate network VLANs.\n\nUsers are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).\nInformation systems automatically lock users such as enabling password-protected screensaver after 2 minutes or less of inactivity.\nInformation systems automatically enter standby or log users off the systems after 30 minutes or less of inactivity.\nThe Security Officer must pre-approves any exception to automatic log off requirements.\n\n\n\n\nPassword Management\n\nUser IDs and passwords are used to control access to CloudCore systems and may not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.\nUsers may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user’s unique user ID and password.\nOn all production systems and applications in the CloudCore environment, password configurations are set to require:\n\na minimum length of 12 characters;\na mix of upper case characters, lower case characters, and numbers or special characters;\na 60-day password expiration, or 60-day password expiration for administrative accounts;\n\nprevention of password reuse using a history of the last 24 passwords;\nwhere supported, modifying at least 6 characters when changing passwords;\naccount lockout after 5 invalid attempts.\n\n!!! check “Exceptions”\n Password expiration may be set to a greater interval if an account is always protected by MFA. \n Currently, Okta SSO password rotation interval is set to 60 days.\nAll system and application passwords must be stored and transmitted securely.\n\nWhere possible, passwords should be stored in a hashed format using a salted cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or stronger NIST compliant standard).\nPasswords that must be stored in non-hashed format must be encrypted at rest pursuant to the requirements in Data Protection.\nTransmitted passwords must be encrypted in flight pursuant to the requirements in Data Protection.\n\nEach information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a pre-determined interval as determined by the system owner and/or Security, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the data contained within the network, system, application, and/or database.\nPasswords are inactivated immediately upon an employee’s termination (refer to the Employee Termination Procedures in HR policy).\nAll default system, application, and Vendor/Partner-provided passwords are changed before deployment to production.\nUpon initial login, users must change any passwords that were automatically generated for them.\nPassword change methods must use a confirmation method to correct for user input errors.\nAll passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.\nIf a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to immediately report the incident to the Security team.\nIn cases where a user has forgotten their password, password reset procedures provided by the IdP shall be followed. The exact process depends on the system or application. If help is needed, users shall contact IT Support or Security\nAn approved password manager is used for to store or share non-critical business application passwords that are not integrated with our primary IdP through SSO.\n\nThe password manager locally encrypts the password vault with the user’s master password before synchronising to the cloud.\nThe master password must follow the password requirements listed above.\nMFA must enabled in the password manager configuration.\nEnrolment of the password manager is configured as an application in Okta.\n\nAn automated process/tool is implemented to ensure compromised passwords or common dictionary words are not used as passwords. This is currently implemented in Okta.\n\n\n\nSingle Sign On\n\nCloudCore selected Okta as its primary Identity Provider (IdP) to control user access to systems and business applications.\nSingle sign-on (SSO) should be used whenever possible instead of local authentication. This centralised approach improves user experience and simplifies access management.\nSSO is configured via industry standard SAML protocol between the IdP (Okta) and the target application.\nCloudCore will not configure SSO to target applications unless they score a “B” rating or higher on the Qualys SSL Labs benchmark.\nSecurity team is responsible for the administration of the IdP / SSO system, including user and access provisioning. Security team may delegate administrative privilege to a subset of the system, such as a specific application.\n\n\n\nMulti-factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is a standard control used by CloudCore to provide strong access control to critical systems and applications, and should be enabled whenever possible.\nCloudCore implements Okta for MFA.\n!!! important\n**Approved MFA methods include:**\n\n- Push notification delivered through the Okta mobile app (default and preferred for end-user access)\n- Hardware MFA token (required for the root user of AWS accounts)\n- A unique cryptographic certificate tied to a device\n- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) delivered through a mobile app, such as Google Authenticator\n- One-time passcode delivered through SMS text message (if it is the only supported option)\n- Secure physical facility (if the system or application can only be accessed at that location)\n\n\nRole Based Access Control (RBAC)\nBy default, user access is granted based on the user’s job function / role. For example:\n\nDeveloper\nSecurity\nIT\nAdministrative\nMarketing / Sales\n\nThis is defined as user groups in .\nAccess to sensitive data and production customer data is highly restricted and further defined in its own section.\n\n\nTemporary Access to AWS Accounts and Resources\nAccess to CloudCore AWS accounts are permissible through temporary credentials / sessions only. No persistent users, passwords or access keys are allowed in AWS IAM configurations for end-user access, either to the AWS console or AWS CLI. This is achieved with the following processes:\nAWS Console Access\n\nAn organisation master account (CloudCore-master) in AWS is configured with IAM roles such as Developer and Security.\nSAML SSO and trust relationship is established between the roles in CloudCore-master and an “AWS application” provisioned in Okta.\nUsers are assigned their corresponding roles through application and role assignment in Okta.\nVia SSO, Users authenticate through Okta by using their Okta username, password, and MFA.\nUpon successful authentication and MFA validation, users are logged into CloudCore-master using AWS Assume Role capability.\nThe roles in CloudCore-master by default has highly restricted access. For example, the Developer role does not have access to any services and resources in the master account.\nThe user is required to Assume a Role in a sub-account, connected via cross-account trust policy defined at account bootstrap or through an approved change management process. For example, a Developer can assume the Administrator role in CloudCore-dev, which is the sandboxed development environment in a separate AWS account.\nAssume Role access to a production AWS account is highly restricted.\n\nDevelopers can only assume the Developer role in production which only has access to read CloudWatch logs, XRay system traces/service maps, CloudWatch metrics, resource group inventories, and CloudWatch dashboards.\nSecurity can only assume the Auditor role in production which has the default Auditor IAM policy managed by AWS. This policy allows read-only access to account and resource configurations, but does not allow read access to any data such as S3 objects.\n\n\nAWS CLI/SDK Access\n\nOkta AWS-CLI Tool is used to obtain temporary credentials (access keys) for developers to connect to AWS using the CLI or SDK.\nBy running the Okta AWS-CLI Tool, developers are prompted to authenticate to Okta using their Okta credentials and MFA token/app.\nUpon successful authentication and MFA validation, a temporary access key and session token is inserted into the local configuration file (e.g. ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config).\nThis temporary credentials expires after one hour and a new temporary credential must be obtained for access.\nThrough this method, developers are granted the same permission as they would by assuming the Developer role through AWS console.\nAdditional details are documented on the Development Wiki.\n\nIAM Safety\n\nCloudCore implements Dome9 to monitor and protect its AWS environments. Dome9 provides an additional layer of defence on top of native IAM policies called IAM Safety.\nIAM Safety works by defining a set of risky actions, such as adding/remove IAM users to an Explicit Deny policy. The policy is attached to an IAM Group, and protected Users and/or Roles are assigned to this Group.\nBecause explicit deny rules always take precedence in AWS IAM policy, this effectively restricts access and prohibits execution of the risky actions as defined in the policy, even if the user/role may have administrative privilege.\nOriginal access can be temporarily restored through the Dome9 web console or its mobile app.\nPrivilege Roles, such as Security role in master account and Administrator role in production account, are protected by IAM Safety.\nAdditional details can be found on Dome9’s product documentation.\n\nTroubleshooting / Support Access\nIn normal operations, troubleshooting is performed with log analysis in Sumo Logic, outside of the production environments in AWS. A separate Support role is created for temporary troubleshooting and support access when log access is insufficient to determine the cause. Support access should be minimised and is designed to involve manual approval and provision process.\n\nThe Support role by default is NOT assigned to anyone.\nThe Support role is configured with Read level access to the services used by CloudCore platform services and applications. It does NOT have permission to make any configuration changes and does NOT have access to production data.\nA PRODCM ticket is used to request temporary support access and must be approved by Head of Engineering and Security.\nUpon approval of the support access PRODCM ticket, Security grants the requestor temporary access to by assigning the Support role to that particular individual user in Okta.\nThe Support role is protected by Dome9 with IAM Safety and it must be explicitly allowed by the Security team for it to assume the Support role in the target production environment.\nBy default, temporary Support access is limited to one hour. This can be extended by the Security team.\nThe role assignment is removed from Okta immediately after the support session and Dome9 IAM Safety is re-enabled.\n\nDual Control for Root Access\nCloudCore implements a Dual Control / Split Knowledge process to protect the Root user access to our AWS accounts. The process works as follow:\n\nSecurity Lead has access to the root account credentials.\n\nThe credentials are stored encrypted in the master account.\nSecurity Lead obtains temporary access to the master account following the process listed above (MFA is required).\nSecurity Lead must assume a role with permission to access the credential (e.g. Administrator), which is protected by an additional layer of IAM Safety.\n\nEngineering Lead has access to the Hardware Tokens associated with the root users.\n\nThe tokens are stored in secured facility with restricted badge reader access.\nThe token serial is mapped per account and documented in CloudCore Engineering Wiki.\n\n\nWhen root access is required for business or operational needs, a Issue is created that requires the Security Lead and Engineering Lead to jointly perform the action.\n\n\nRemote Access / VPN\n\nVPN remote access to non-production and non-privileged environments in AWS are permissible and implemented using Pritunl.\nVPN remote access to master and production accounts are prohibited.\nVPN remote access to CloudCore office network(s) is configured via Pritunl, and should be used whenever connecting from public networks.\n\n\n\nAccess to PHI/ePHI\n\nAccess to ePHI is permitted to genomics science staff, or staff that otherwise has a business need to access.\nAccess to any on-premise server that contains ePHI is restricted and monitored. Currently CloudCore has no on-premise server that stores or processes ePHI.\nAccess to ePHI in CloudCore’s production environments in the cloud is strictly prohibited. Access is protected via multiple layers of security controls such as IAM policies, restricted IAM roles, VPC configuration, S3 bucket policy, external monitoring, etc.\nUsers may not download ePHI to any workstations or end-user computing devices.\n\n\n\nPlatform Customer Access to Systems\nCloudCore does not allow direct system access by customers. Access is only available through the Web UI or API interface, with valid authentication and authorisation detailed in the Product Security, Architecture, and Security pages of the engineering wiki.\n\n\nAccess Establishment, Modification and Termination\n\nRequests for access to CloudCore Platform systems and applications is made formally using the following process:\n\nAn access request is created in through either the new employee onboarding request or a specific access request from CloudCore Internal Support site.\nThe Security team will grant standard access to per job role as part of new employee onboarding. A standard set of accounts that are default for all employees are created as part of the onboarding process. This includes\n\nUser account for local system/laptop\nOkta user in the Everyone group, and additional group based on role such as Development, IT, Security\nOffice365 account for access to Outlook email, SharePoint, etc.\nAtaata account for security awareness training\nHR accounts for paperwork, benefits management, payroll, expense reporting, etc.\naccess for submitting support requests\nAdditional role based access (e.g. and access for a developer)\n\nStandard access may be provisioned at any time by account owners/administrators at any time during or after onboarding with approval of account owners and/or manager.\nIf additional access is needed in addition to the above, a separate access request (through ) is required and the requester must include a description and justification as part of the access request.\nOnce the review is completed, the Security team approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.\nIf the review is approved, IT or Security team provisions access, then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.\n\nNew accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that meets all password requirements, which must be changed on the initial login.\nAll password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.\nFor on-premise systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP/AD group.\nFor cloud accounts, access grants are provisioned in Okta or using the access control mechanisms built into those services/applications.\nAccount management for non-production systems may be delegated to a CloudCore employee at the discretion of the Security Officer.\n\n\nSpecial access, including access to production environments, is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the CloudCore Security Officer.\nThe request for access is retained for future reference.\nTemporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.\n\nAccounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.\nAccounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.\n\nIn the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required.\n\n\nAccess Termination\nIT Manager or Security team receives access termination requests in one of the following conditions and processes it accordingly:\n\nEmployee existing/termination, as defined by the process in HR & Employee Security;\nEmployee access to a system is no longer required as a result of job role change or similar event, in which case a access termination request may be submitted by the employee or his/her manager via the Internal Help portal or an email request to Security team;\nAs the result of a Access Review, as defined in System Auditing.\nNon-standard access is revoked by default after 30 days of inactivity, unless an exception/extension is requested and approved.\n\n\n\n\nAccess Reviews\n\nAll access to CloudCore systems and services are reviewed and updated following the procedures specified in System Auditing to ensure proper authorisations are in place commensurate with job functions.\nIn cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorised access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorised access.\n\n\n\nPrivileged Access\nPrivileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before elevating the privilege or switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks. Examples include:\n\nsudo in Linux/macOS\nRun as Administrator in Windows\nAssume role in AWS\n\n\n\nService Accounts\n\nAll application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.\nServices that are part of CloudCore platform leverage AWS IAM policy configurations and/or OAuth for authorisation.\nGeneric accounts are not allowed on CloudCore systems.\nDirect system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorisation are limited and controlled to restrict access.\nIn AWS, service accounts are implemented in the form of IAM Roles, and their access defined by the corresponding IAM policies. The creation of these IAM roles and policies is implemented as code, which follows the secure development, review and production change approval process.\nAn inventory of all Service accounts is maintained by AWS IAM and Terraform and reviewed periodically.\n\n\n\nEmployee Workstation / Endpoints Access and Usage\nAll workstations at CloudCore are company owned, using one the following approved hardware vendors and operating systems:\n\nApple, Dell, or Lenovo\nmacOS, Linux (Ubuntu or Debian), or Windows 10\n\n\nWorkstations may not be used to engage in any activity that is illegal or is in violation of organisation’s policies.\nAccess may not be used for transmitting, retrieving, or storage of any communications of a discriminatory or harassing nature or materials that are obscene or “X-rated”. Harassment of any kind is prohibited. No messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual’s race, age, disability, religion, national origin, physical attributes, sexual preference, or health condition shall be transmitted or maintained. No abusive, hostile, profane, or offensive language is to be transmitted through organisation’s system.\nInformation systems/applications also may not be used for any other purpose that is illegal, unethical, or against company policies or contrary to organisation’s best interests. Messages containing information related to a lawsuit or investigation may not be sent without prior approval.\nSolicitation of non-company business, or any use of organisation’s information systems/applications for personal gain is prohibited.\nUsers may not misrepresent, obscure, suppress, or replace another user’s identity in transmitted or stored messages.\nWorkstation hard drives will be encrypted using FileVault (macOS), BitLocker (Windows) or equivalent.\nAll workstations must have host firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorised access unless explicitly granted.\nAll workstations must have endpoint security software installed and actively running, if supported by the operating system.\n\n\n\nOffice Network and Wireless Access\n\nCloudCore production systems are not accessible directly over wireless channels.\nWireless access is disabled on all production systems.\nWhen accessing production systems via remote wireless connections, the same system access policies and procedures apply to wireless as all other connections, including wired.\nWireless networks managed within CloudCore non-production facilities (offices, etc.) are secured with the following configurations:\n\nAll data in transit over wireless is encrypted using WPA2 encryption;\nPasswords are not currently on a rotation schedule because the office environments are considered insecure.\n\nPasswords are changed immediately should a suspicious activity or indicator of compromise is detected.\nGuest wireless access is on a separate SSID configured with different password and traffic VLAN.\nWireless access is managed by the IT Manager.\nWireless access points connected to the network are automatically scanned; rogue access points identified are immediately removed.\n\n\n\n\nProduction Access and Secrets Management\nCloudCore leverages a combination of credentials store, credstash, and Amason EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store production secrets. Secrets are always encrypted; access to secrets is always controlled and audited.\nDetails and usage are documented on the CloudCore Engineering Wiki.\n\n\nProduction Data Access\nThe following requirements and controls are in place for accessing production data by internal personnel:\n\nThere is no pre-provisioned, persisted “internal” access to production data stores. Access such as direct SSH to the production database servers and direct access to data objects in production S3 buckets are prohibited.\nAccess to customer data is granted on a per-account basis.\nAccess requests follow the same production access processes. Access must be approved by both the data owner and the security team.\nAccess to production data is granted only through an approved platform with strong centralised access control, with MFA.\nAn audit list of who has access to which customer data is maintained and reviewed monthly. Access is revoked when no longer needed.\n\n\n\nPassword Reset and other Helpdesk Requests\nCloudCore employees have the ability to obtain self-service support directly from supported business applications, such as password reset via the SSO/IdP tool.\nIf needed, users may use our internal service desk or email request to obtain IT and Security support.\nA ticket is opened in for each support request and assigned to the appropriate personnel. The person assigned must verify the identity of the requester and ensure the ticket has appropriate approval before implementing or providing support. The verification step and confirmation of “User identity verified” should be included as a comment in the ticket by the support personnel. Additionally, if a password or security credential has been created or supplied, confirm user has received it via another channel like slack/email/phone/zoom and document receipt in the ticket."

    "text": "CloudCore Networks Incident Report\nIncident ID: CCN-BR-0924\nReport Date: September 14, 2024\nIncident Reported By: Network Operations Center (NOC) Team\nSeverity Level: Critical\nAffected Systems: Customer Database, User Authentication System\nStatus: Contained and Under Investigation\n\n1. Overview of the Incident\nOn September 12, 2024, CloudCore Networks detected unusual activity involving unauthorised access to the customer database. The breach was discovered when automated monitoring systems flagged a spike in database queries originating from an internal network segment typically reserved for administrative purposes. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that the attackers had gained access using compromised credentials of a senior system administrator.\n\n\n2. Timeline of Events\n\nSeptember 11, 2024, 14:00: A phishing email was sent to multiple employees, crafted to appear as a security update notice from CloudCore’s internal IT team. The email contained a link to a malicious website mimicking the company’s login portal.\nSeptember 11, 2024, 14:30: A senior system administrator, John Doe, unknowingly clicked on the phishing link and entered his credentials on the fake portal. The attacker immediately captured these credentials.\nSeptember 11, 2024, 15:00: The attacker used John Doe’s credentials to log into CloudCore’s network via the VPN, bypassing multi-factor authentication due to the senior-level access privileges that were not properly configured for MFA enforcement.\nSeptember 11, 2024, 16:00: The attacker escalated privileges to gain access to the customer database using John Doe’s admin credentials. Data exfiltration scripts were executed to export customer records.\nSeptember 12, 2024, 09:00: The NOC team’s automated monitoring systems detected an unusual volume of database queries and flagged the activity as suspicious. An alert was generated.\nSeptember 12, 2024, 09:15: The Security Operations Center (SOC) initiated an investigation into the alert and confirmed unauthorised access to the customer database. Immediate actions were taken to contain the breach by revoking access privileges and isolating the compromised accounts.\nSeptember 12, 2024, 10:00: The incident was escalated to the incident response team, who began a comprehensive forensic investigation to assess the extent of the breach and identify vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n3. Extent of Data Compromised\n\nApproximately 250,000 customer records were compromised, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and payment information.\nNo encrypted data was directly exposed; however, the attacker had access to decryption keys stored within the compromised environment.\nNo system integrity alterations were detected, but the risk of data manipulation remains under investigation.\n\n\n\n4. Immediate Actions Taken\n\nAll compromised accounts were disabled, and passwords reset protocols were initiated across the affected systems.\nMulti-factor authentication enforcement was immediately expanded to include all administrative access accounts.\nThe affected database was taken offline to prevent further unauthorised access, and a backup restoration process was started.\nAn incident response team was deployed to conduct a full forensic analysis and identify the root cause.\n\n\n\n5. Technical Details and Logs\nLog Entry Sample - VPN Access:\nSep 11 15:00:03 CCN-VPN-01: User 'jdoe' authenticated from IP 192.168.100.101 via VPN. Authentication method: password.\nSep 11 15:00:05 CCN-VPN-01: MFA check bypassed for user 'jdoe' due to admin-level privilege exception.\nLog Entry Sample - Database Queries:\nSep 11 16:02:47 DB-Server-01: QUERY - SELECT * FROM customer_data WHERE sensitive_info = 'true';\nSep 11 16:05:30 DB-Server-01: EXPORT - User 'jdoe_admin' executed data export script on customer_data table.\nError Messages: - System Alert: “Unusual query volume detected on DB-Server-01. Review required.” - SOC Alert: “Potential data breach detected. User ‘jdoe_admin’ executing high-risk operations. Immediate containment required.”\n\n\n6. Vulnerabilities Identified\n\nPhishing Vulnerability: Lack of robust email filtering and user training on identifying phishing attempts.\nMFA Gaps: Inconsistent enforcement of multi-factor authentication, particularly for senior-level administrative accounts.\nAccess Control Weaknesses: Overly broad administrative privileges and failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege.\nMonitoring and Response Delay: Initial detection was delayed due to the failure of real-time monitoring to prioritise anomalous behavior adequately.\n\n\n\n7. Next Steps\n\nA detailed audit of all user accounts and access privileges is underway to tighten security controls.\nImmediate rollout of enhanced security training for all employees, focusing on phishing awareness and secure access practices.\nComprehensive review and upgrade of the current MFA implementation to ensure uniform enforcement across all access levels.\nFull incident report to be compiled with recommendations for further security improvements and presented to the executive board."

    "section": "Risk Assessment",
    "text": "Risk Assessment\nRisk Assessment is a structured and systematic process to identify, analyse, and evaluate the risks associated with the potential misuse, loss, damage, or exposure of the organisation’s assets. For CloudCore Networks, the risk assessment process would involve several steps:\n1. Asset Identification: The first step involves identifying all information assets that could be affected by potential threats. In the case of CloudCore Networks, assets would include:\n\nPhysical Assets: Data centers, server hardware, network equipment, workstations, laptops, and mobile devices.\nDigital Assets: Customer data (financial records, healthcare data, IP, PII, and corporate emails), proprietary company data, databases, software applications, system logs, configuration files, backup files.\nHuman Assets: Employees and contractors who handle, manage, or have access to the company’s information assets.\nIntangible Assets: CloudCore Networks’ reputation, brand value, customer trust.\n\n2. Threat Identification: The next step is to identify the potential threats to each of these assets. Threats could be:\n\nNatural disasters: Fires, floods, earthquakes which could impact physical infrastructure.\nCyber threats: Malware, phishing attacks, hacking attempts, DDoS attacks, insider threats.\nHuman error: Accidental data deletion, misconfiguration of systems, improper handling of sensitive data.\nLegal and regulatory: Non-compliance to data protection laws such as Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) or GDPR for European customers.\n\n3. Vulnerability Assessment: This step involves identifying the vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by potential threats. Vulnerabilities might be outdated software, weak encryption, insecure network protocols, lack of user awareness, or lack of regular security audits.\n4. Risk Evaluation: Once assets, threats, and vulnerabilities are identified, CloudCore Networks would need to evaluate the risk. This involves calculating the potential impact and likelihood of each risk.\nImpact could be assessed in terms of financial loss, reputation damage, or operational disruption. Likelihood is determined based on the current security controls, the frequency of the threat occurrence in the industry, and the organisation’s history of security incidents.\nFor example, a DDoS attack on CloudCore’s servers might have a high impact, causing disruption to their services and significant reputation damage. If their network security controls are not robust, and given the frequency of DDoS attacks in the industry, the likelihood could be high.\n5. Risk Prioritisation: After the risks have been evaluated, they are prioritised based on their impact and likelihood. High impact and high likelihood risks would be prioritised for immediate treatment.\nThe risk assessment would be an ongoing process, repeated at regular intervals, or when significant changes occur in the business or the external environment. The risk landscape is constantly evolving, especially in the IT industry, and CloudCore Networks must keep its risk assessment updated to maintain the effectiveness of its ISMS.\nThe outcome of the risk assessment would provide a clear understanding of the organisation’s risk exposure and form the basis for the subsequent Risk Treatment process, where appropriate security controls are selected and implemented."

    "title": "CloudCore Networks Information Security Management System",
    "section": "Risk Treatment",
    "text": "Risk Treatment\nRisk Treatment is the process of selecting and implementing measures to modify risk. Risk treatment invariably involves balancing the costs of implementing the control against the losses that would be expected if the control is not in place. The ultimate aim is to reduce the risks to an acceptable level considering the organisational context and risk appetite.\nIn the case of CloudCore Networks, the risk treatment process would involve the following steps:\n1. Selection of Risk Treatment Options: There are generally four ways to deal with risks:\n\nRisk Acceptance: Where the risk is deemed to be low, or the cost of implementing controls outweighs the potential damage, the risk may be accepted. This does not eliminate the risk but is an acknowledgement of it. An example could be a minor software vulnerability in a non-critical system with no sensitive data.\nRisk Avoidance: This involves not performing an activity that could carry risk. For instance, if a third-party software is identified as a serious threat to the network, CloudCore Networks might avoid using it altogether.\nRisk Mitigation: This involves implementing controls to minimise the impact or likelihood of the risk. This could be implementing strong firewalls and DDoS protection measures to reduce the risk of cyber attacks, or regular employee training to reduce the risk of human error.\nRisk Transfer: This means handing over the risk to a third party, typically an insurer. CloudCore Networks could have insurance to cover the financial impact of certain types of data breaches or physical damages.\n\n2. Implementation of Controls: Based on the selected treatment options, appropriate controls are implemented. These controls would be selected from the ISO 27001 Annex A, a comprehensive list of best-practice controls for information security, or other relevant control sets.\nControls can be:\n\nPreventive: Measures that prevent a risk from occurring, such as strong access controls and data encryption.\nDetective: Measures that identify when a risk event has occurred or is occurring, like intrusion detection systems or regular security audits.\nCorrective: Measures that recover operations after a risk event, like backup and restore procedures or disaster recovery plans.\n\nIn the case of CloudCore Networks, we use a combination of these controls. For example, to treat the risk of DDoS attacks, they could use preventive controls like firewalls and DDoS protection services, detective controls like network monitoring tools, and corrective controls like incident response and disaster recovery plans.\n3. Documentation: All risk treatment information should be documented in a Risk Treatment Plan. This includes the details of the risks, selected treatment options, assigned responsibilities, proposed actions, priorities, and deadlines. The documentation would provide a clear roadmap for managing the identified risks and maintaining accountability.\n4. Monitoring and Review: After the controls are implemented, their effectiveness should be monitored and reviewed regularly. For instance, CloudCore Networks could conduct periodic testing or auditing of its controls, like penetration testing for cyber threats or fire drills for physical threats.\n5. Residual Risk Assessment: After the risk treatment process, there may still be some level of risk remaining, known as residual risk. This risk should be evaluated and compared against the organisation’s risk acceptance criteria to decide if additional controls are necessary or if the residual risk can be accepted.\nRisk treatment is a crucial component of the ISMS and a continuous process that evolves with the changing risk landscape and business context. CloudCore Networks would need to ensure that its risk treatment process is robust, adaptable, and aligned with its business objectives and risk appetite."

    "section": "Information Security Objectives",
    "text": "Information Security Objectives\nInformation Security Objectives define what the organisation intends to achieve with its Information Security Management System (ISMS). These objectives must be aligned with the business’s overall strategic goals and be measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\nIn the case of CloudCore Networks, the Information Security Objectives include:\n1. Ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of Information: As a cloud hosting and managed IT service provider, CloudCore Networks handles a wide range of sensitive customer data. The company needs to ensure the confidentiality of this data to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, maintain the integrity of the data to prevent unauthorised modification or destruction, and guarantee its availability to prevent disruption to the services.\n2. Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements: Being based in Perth, Australia, CloudCore Networks needs to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the Health Records Act 2001. Moreover, if they serve customers in Europe, they need to comply with the GDPR. One of the objectives would be to ensure ongoing compliance with these and any other applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.\n3. Continual Improvement of the ISMS: CloudCore Networks should strive for continual improvement of its ISMS to keep up with the evolving threat landscape and business context. This could include improving security controls, processes, or competencies based on the findings from audits, incidents, or changes in the environment.\n4. Strengthening Incident Response Capability: The company should aim to strengthen its capability to respond to information security incidents. This could involve enhancing incident detection mechanisms, reducing the time taken to respond to incidents, or improving the effectiveness of incident recovery procedures.\n5. Enhancing Employee Awareness and Training: Given that human error can be a significant security risk, CloudCore Networks should aim to enhance employee awareness about information security. This could involve increasing the coverage or effectiveness of security awareness training or improving the compliance with security policies and procedures.\n6. Reducing the Number of Security Incidents: An objective could be to reduce the number or severity of security incidents, which could be measured by monitoring incident reports over time.\n7. Maintaining Customer Trust: As a service provider, maintaining customer trust is crucial for CloudCore Networks. An objective could be to maintain or enhance the level of customer trust, which could be measured through customer surveys or feedback.\nEach objective should be associated with one or more key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure its achievement. For instance, the objective of reducing the number of security incidents could be measured with the KPI of the number of incidents reported per quarter. The KPIs should be reviewed regularly, and the results should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ISMS and guide its continual improvement.\nThe setting of Information Security Objectives is a strategic process that requires a clear understanding of the organisation’s business goals, risk environment, and stakeholder expectations. The objectives provide a clear direction for the ISMS and a basis for measuring and improving its performance.\nThe “Security Policies and Procedures” chapter of the ISMS is a crucial one as it outlines the rules, practices, and guidelines the organisation must follow to protect its information assets. While it can indeed include a list and description of all your policies and procedures, it also serves to communicate the organisation’s stance on information security to all relevant parties.\nHere are the key elements:\n1. Purpose of the Policies and Procedures: This section articulates the need for the security policies and procedures, their role in achieving the organisation’s security objectives, and the consequences of not adhering to them.\n2. Scope: This defines who the policies and procedures apply to. This would typically include all employees and contractors, but it could also extend to third parties like suppliers or customers, depending on the nature of the organisation’s operations and risks.\n3. Roles and Responsibilities: This outlines who is responsible for implementing, maintaining, and enforcing each policy and procedure. Typically, this would include roles like the CISO, IT managers, system administrators, and all users of the information systems.\n4. List and Description of Policies and Procedures: This is where you list all your policies and procedures, along with a brief description of each. It could include policies like the Acceptable Use Policy, Access Control Policy, Data Classification Policy, Incident Response Procedure, etc. Each policy and procedure should be documented in detail separately, but in this chapter, you just need to provide an overview of what each one covers.\n5. Compliance Requirements: This section describes how the policies and procedures meet the organisation’s legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, as well as any industry standards or best practices they follow.\n6. Review and Update Process: This outlines the process for reviewing and updating the policies and procedures. This should be done regularly, or when significant changes occur in the business or the risk environment.\n7. Training and Awareness: This describes how the organisation ensures that all relevant parties are aware of and understand the policies and procedures. This could involve regular training sessions, reminders, or tests.\nThe “Security Policies and Procedures” chapter serves to establish a solid foundation for your ISMS by providing clear guidelines on how information security is managed in your organisation. It’s important to ensure that all your policies and procedures are aligned with your risk treatment plan and help you achieve your information security objectives."

Improvement Inputs\nSeveral sources of information feed into the continuous improvement process:\n\nAudit findings: Both internal and external audits provide valuable insights into the performance of our ISMS and areas where we can improve.\nManagement reviews: These high-level reviews may identify strategic changes that need to be made to our ISMS.\nIncident reports: Analysis of security incidents and near misses can reveal vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.\nEmployee feedback: Employees often have practical suggestions for improving our security procedures and controls.\nCustomer feedback: Feedback from our customers can help us better align our ISMS with their needs and expectations.\nRegulatory changes: Updates to laws or regulations may require us to make changes to our ISMS.\nTechnology changes: New technologies or changes to our IT infrastructure can present opportunities for improving our security controls.\n\n5. Improvement Actions\nBased on these inputs, the CISO, in collaboration with the IT team and other relevant stakeholders, develops a plan of action to improve the ISMS. This might involve:\n\nUpdating policies and procedures\nImplementing new or improved security controls\nConducting additional training\nInvesting in new security technologies\n\nEach improvement action is assigned a responsible person, a deadline, and a set of success criteria. The improvement actions are tracked and their effectiveness is assessed to ensure they are producing the desired results.\n6. Monitoring and Measurement\nTo gauge the effectiveness of the improvement efforts, key performance indicators (KPIs) are used. These can include metrics such as the number of incidents, audit findings, training participation rates, and system uptime. These KPIs are regularly reviewed and reported to ensure the ISMS is moving in the desired direction.\n7. Iterative Process\nContinuous Improvement is an ongoing, iterative process. After the implementation of improvements, another cycle of measurement, feedback, and adjustment begins. This keeps the ISMS continually adapting and evolving.\nIn conclusion, continuous improvement is the key to maintaining an effective and robust ISMS. It enables CloudCore Networks to stay proactive in the face of an ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, ensuring that our customers’ data remains secure and our business resilient."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nCloudCore Networks is a mid-sized cloud service provider specialising in delivering scalable and efficient cloud solutions to clients across industries such as finance, healthcare, and education. With recent expansions into enterprise-level services, CloudCore has prioritised cybersecurity as a critical component of its business operations. However, the recent data breach has exposed significant vulnerabilities, prompting a comprehensive review of its security posture.\n\n\nStrengths\n\nAdvanced Cloud Infrastructure:\n\nCloudCore operates a hybrid cloud environment integrating both public and private clouds, providing flexibility and scalability tailored to client needs.\nUse of advanced virtualisation technologies and distributed data centers enhances redundancy, disaster recovery, and operational efficiency.\n\nCompliance with Industry Standards:\n\nThe company adheres to major cybersecurity frameworks, including ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, aligning its policies and procedures with industry best practices.\nRegular internal audits and compliance checks ensure that security measures are up to date with regulatory requirements, especially in high-stakes industries like healthcare and finance.\n\nAutomated Monitoring and Incident Detection:\n\nCloudCore has implemented automated monitoring systems that provide real-time alerts for unusual activities, such as high-volume database queries and unauthorised access attempts.\nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are in place to correlate and analyse logs across the network, helping to identify potential threats promptly.\n\nStrong Network Security Measures:\n\nUse of multi-tier firewall architectures, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and encrypted communication channels between data centers help protect the network perimeter.\nRegular network security assessments and penetration testing are conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\nCustomer-Centric Approach to Data Protection:\n\nCloudCore places a high priority on protecting customer data, with encryption in transit and at rest, along with stringent access controls for sensitive information.\nDedicated support for security issues and transparency in communication help maintain customer trust and engagement.\n\nProactive Security Culture:\n\nSecurity awareness training is mandatory for all employees, with additional emphasis on phishing and social engineering defenses.\nThe security team actively engages in threat intelligence sharing with industry partners, enhancing its ability to anticipate and defend against emerging threats.\n\n\n\n\nIdentified Vulnerabilities\n\nInconsistent Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement:\n\nWhile MFA is deployed across most user accounts, it is inconsistently enforced for senior-level administrative accounts. This inconsistency allowed attackers to exploit compromised credentials in the recent breach.\nA review of access control policies is needed to ensure uniform application of MFA across all access levels, especially for privileged accounts.\n\nPhishing Susceptibility:\n\nThe recent breach highlighted weaknesses in employee recognition of phishing attempts, indicating that current security training programs may not be sufficiently effective.\nEnhancing training programs and implementing advanced phishing simulation exercises could help reduce susceptibility.\n\nOverly Broad Access Permissions:\n\nSome administrative accounts have access privileges that exceed their operational requirements, violating the principle of least privilege.\nA comprehensive access review and rights-sizing initiative are necessary to minimise unnecessary access and potential insider threats.\n\nGaps in API Security:\n\nVulnerabilities in the security of exposed APIs, including insufficient validation and inadequate rate limiting, pose a risk of unauthorised data access.\nRegular API security assessments and implementation of API gateways with integrated security controls are recommended to address these gaps.\n\nDelayed Detection and Response:\n\nAlthough automated monitoring systems are in place, the initial detection of the breach was delayed due to insufficient prioritisation of anomalous behaviour.\nEnhancing SIEM rules and increasing the frequency of incident response drills could improve the speed and effectiveness of breach detection and containment.\n\nWeak Endpoint Security:\n\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions are not fully integrated across all devices, leading to inconsistent endpoint security measures.\nExpanding EDR coverage and enforcing strict endpoint security protocols would provide better visibility and control over potential entry points.\n\nLack of Regular Security Updates and Patch Management:\n\nSome systems and software components were found to be outdated, with critical security patches not applied promptly, increasing the risk of exploitation.\nA robust patch management process, including automated patch deployment and regular update schedules, is needed to ensure all systems remain secure.\n\nInsufficient Data Encryption Key Management:\n\nAlthough data encryption is in place, the recent breach revealed that decryption keys were accessible within the compromised environment, highlighting a weakness in key management practices.\nImplementing a secure key management solution, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or cloud-based key management service, would strengthen data protection.\n\n\n\n\nSummary and Recommendations\nCloudCore Networks has established a strong foundation in cybersecurity with advanced infrastructure, compliance with industry standards, and a proactive approach to security culture. However, the identified vulnerabilities—particularly in access control, phishing defences, API security, and endpoint management—require urgent attention to prevent future breaches."

Offered with all CloudCore Add-ons and as an option for PaaS Customers.\nBreach: A data breach is the intentional or unintentional release of secure or sensitive information to an untrusted environment or individual. A data breach often involves an incident where information is stolen or taken from a system without the knowledge or authorisation of the system’s owner.\nUnder HIPAA, a data breach means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI. For purpose of this definition, “compromises the security or privacy of the PHI” means poses a significant risk of financial, reputation, or other harm to the individual. A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include the identifiers listed at §164.514(e)(2), limited data set, date of birth, and sip code does not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:\n\nAny unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) or Business Associate (BA) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.\nAny inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorised to access PHI at a CE or BA to another person authorised to access PHI at the same CE or BA, or organised health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.\nA disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an unauthorised person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.\n\nBusiness Associate: A person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity.\nCovered Entity: A health plan, health care clearinghouse, or a healthcare provider who transmits any health information in electronic form.\nDe-identification: The process of removing identifiable information so that data is rendered to not be personally identifiable (not PHI).\nDisaster Recovery: The ability to recover a system and data after being made unavailable.\nDisaster Recovery Service: A disaster recovery service for disaster recovery in the case of system unavailability.

Examples of events include, but are not limited to:\n\nA hard drive malfunction that requires replacement;\nSystems become unavailable due to power outage that is non-hostile in nature, with redundancy to assure ongoing availability of data;\nAccidental lockout of an account due to incorrectly entering a password multiple times.\n\nHardware (or hard drive): Any computing device able to create and store sensitive data (i.e. ePHI).\nHealth and Human Services (HHS): The government body that maintains HIPAA.\nIaaS: Infrastructure-as-a-Service.\nIndividually Identifiable Health Information: That information that is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual, and is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and identifies the individual; or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.\nIndication: A sign that an Incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time. Examples of indications include:\n\nThe network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a known exploit occurs against an FTP server. Intrusion detection is generally reactive, looking only for footprints of known attacks. It is important to note that many IDS “hits” are also false positives and are neither an event nor an incident;\nThe antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with a worm;\nUsers complain of slow access to hosts on the Internet;\nThe system administrator sees a filename with unusual characteristics;\nAutomated alerts of activity from log monitors like OSSEC;\nAn alert from OSSEC about file system integrity issues.\n\nIntrusion Detection System (IDS): A software tool use to automatically detect and notify in the event of possible unauthorised network and/or system access.\nIDS Service: An Intrusion Detection Service for providing IDS notification to customers in the case of suspicious activity.

Threats are commonly categorised as:\n\nEnvironmental - external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.\nHuman - hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, SPAM, vandalism, etc.\nNatural - fires, floods, electrical storms, tornados, etc.\nTechnological - server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages, hasardous material spills.\nOther - explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc.\n\nThreat Source: Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system. Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organisation’s ability to protect sensitive data.\nThreat Action: The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).\nUnrestricted Area: Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organisational information is not stored or is not utilised or is not accessible there on a regular basis.\nUnsecured Protected Health Information: Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorised individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.\n\nElectronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.\nValid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.\nValid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.\nThe media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:\nPaper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.\nElectronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitisation, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.\n\nVendor: External individuals or organisations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to CloudCore.\nVulnerability: A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.\nWorkstation: An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, smart phones, tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, “workstation” also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.\nWorkforce: Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity."

    "title": "Future-Proofing CloudCore: Recommendations Post-Data Breach",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Publication: SecureTech Journal\nDate: September 18, 2024\nAuthor: Marcus Hale, Cybersecurity Consultant\n\nIntroduction\nThe recent data breach at CloudCore Networks has prompted a critical review of the company’s security measures. As CloudCore looks to rebuild and fortify its defenses, there are key areas that need urgent attention. This article outlines a set of strategic recommendations to help CloudCore enhance its security posture and prevent future incidents.\n\n1. Strengthening Access Controls and MFA Implementation\nOne of the primary weaknesses exploited in the breach was inconsistent enforcement of multi-factor authentication (MFA), particularly for high-privilege accounts. To address this, CloudCore should implement a unified access management policy that enforces MFA across all accounts without exceptions.\nRecommendations: - Universal MFA: Ensure that MFA is a mandatory requirement for all users, including administrators and third-party vendors. Consider using phishing-resistant methods such as FIDO2 security keys. - Access Reviews: Conduct regular access reviews to ensure that permissions align with the principle of least privilege, reducing the potential impact of compromised accounts.\n\n2. Enhancing Phishing Awareness and Training Programs\nThe breach was initiated by a phishing attack, highlighting the need for improved employee awareness and training. CloudCore should implement more rigorous phishing simulations and provide ongoing education to help employees recognize and report suspicious activities.\nRecommendations: - **Continuous Training\n:** Move beyond annual training sessions to a continuous learning model, where employees receive regular updates and simulations on the latest phishing tactics. - Gamification: Introduce gamified training modules that reward employees for successfully identifying and reporting phishing attempts, fostering a culture of vigilance.\n\n3. Advanced Threat Detection and Incident Response Automation\nWhile CloudCore has monitoring tools in place, the breach revealed gaps in alert prioritization and response times. Investing in advanced threat detection technologies, such as AI-driven anomaly detection and automated response systems, can help CloudCore detect and contain threats more effectively.\nRecommendations: - Behavioral Analytics: Deploy AI-based solutions that can analyze user and network behavior, flagging anomalies that deviate from normal patterns. - Automated Playbooks: Implement automated incident response playbooks that can trigger immediate actions, such as isolating affected systems, based on predefined criteria.\n\n4. Improving API Security and Data Protection\nThe breach involved unauthorized access to APIs, which were inadequately protected. CloudCore should prioritize securing its APIs by implementing robust authentication, input validation, and rate limiting to prevent abuse.\nRecommendations: - API Gateway: Use API gateways to centralize security controls, including authentication, authorization, and monitoring of API traffic. - Data Encryption: Ensure that all sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, is encrypted using strong encryption standards. Implement strict key management practices to protect encryption keys.\n\n5. Establishing a Culture of Security\nBeyond technical measures, building a strong security culture is essential for sustaining long-term resilience. CloudCore should emphasize the importance of security across all levels of the organization, integrating it into the company’s core values.\nRecommendations: - Leadership Involvement: Involve senior leadership in security initiatives, ensuring that security is a top priority across the company. - Security Champions: Identify and train security champions within each department to advocate for security best practices and serve as liaisons with the security team.\n\nConclusion\nThe data breach at CloudCore Networks offers a valuable opportunity for the company to reassess and enhance its security measures. By implementing these recommendations, CloudCore can not only address the vulnerabilities that led to the breach but also position itself as a leader in cloud security. With a comprehensive, proactive approach to cybersecurity, CloudCore can regain the trust of its customers and stakeholders, emerging stronger and more resilient in the face of future challenges."

    "title": "Massive Data Breach Hits CloudCore Networks, Exposing Customer Records",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Publication: TechSecurity Daily\nDate: September 13, 2024\nAuthor: Megan Thompson\nCloudCore Networks, a prominent provider of cloud services, has confirmed a major data breach that exposed the personal and financial information of approximately 250,000 customers. The breach was discovered on September 12, 2024, and is believed to have been caused by a sophisticated cyber-attack involving compromised employee credentials.\nAccording to CloudCore’s initial statement, the attackers gained unauthorized access to a critical customer database, resulting in the exposure of sensitive data, including names, addresses, email addresses, and payment information. The company has assured customers that no passwords or social security numbers were compromised, though financial information such as credit card details was part of the breach.\n“We deeply regret this incident and are working diligently to mitigate its impact,” said Sophia Martinez, Chief Information Security Officer at CloudCore Networks. “We have taken immediate steps to contain the breach and are cooperating with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to investigate the matter thoroughly.”\nInitial reports suggest that the breach originated from a phishing attack that compromised the credentials of a senior system administrator, allowing the attackers to bypass multi-factor authentication. This highlights the persistent threat of phishing as a primary vector for cyber-attacks, even among companies with robust security measures in place.\nIndustry Response\nIndustry experts are urging companies to review their security protocols in light of this incident. “This breach serves as a reminder that even organizations with strong security postures are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks,” said John Harper, a cybersecurity analyst at SecureNet Consulting. “Organizations need to continuously evaluate and update their security measures, particularly around access controls and employee training.”\nCloudCore Networks has begun notifying affected customers and is offering credit monitoring services as a precautionary measure. The company has also launched a dedicated support line to assist those impacted by the breach.\nCustomer Concerns\nWhile CloudCore has acted swiftly, customer concerns are growing as more details emerge. “I’m worried about how this will affect my personal information,” said Mary Collins, a long-time CloudCore customer. “It’s alarming to think that such a trusted company could be compromised.”\nThe breach has prompted an investigation by regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has been increasingly scrutinizing data breaches that affect consumer privacy.\nAs the investigation unfolds, CloudCore Networks is expected to face intense scrutiny over its security practices and the effectiveness of its incident response. The full scope of the breach’s impact remains to be seen, but the incident is already shaping up to be one of the most significant cybersecurity challenges the company has faced."

    "title": "CloudCore Networks Data Breach: A Technical Breakdown",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Publication: CyberDefense Review\nDate: September 16, 2024\nAuthor: Dr. Alex Reynolds, Cybersecurity Expert\n\nIntroduction\nThe recent data breach at CloudCore Networks has raised significant concerns across the cybersecurity community. With 250,000 customer records compromised, including sensitive personal and financial information, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the evolving threats facing cloud service providers. In this article, we will delve into the technical aspects of the breach, exploring how it occurred, the vulnerabilities exploited, and what can be done to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n1. Entry Point: Phishing Attack and Credential Compromise\nThe breach began with a targeted phishing campaign that successfully compromised the credentials of a senior system administrator at CloudCore Networks. Phishing remains one of the most effective methods for cyber attackers to gain initial access, as it exploits the human element—a known weak link in many security chains.\nKey Technical Failures: - Credential Theft: Attackers used a phishing email disguised as an internal IT communication, prompting the administrator to log in to a fake portal, thereby capturing their credentials. - MFA Bypass: While multi-factor authentication (MFA) was in place, it was inconsistently enforced, especially for high-level administrative accounts. This inconsistency allowed attackers to bypass MFA protections once credentials were obtained.\nTechnical Recommendation:\nTo mitigate such risks, organizations should enforce MFA universally across all accounts, particularly for privileged users. Additionally, implementing phishing-resistant MFA methods, such as hardware security keys or app-based authentication, can add another layer of security.\n\n2. Exploitation of Network Misconfigurations\nOnce inside, the attackers exploited a misconfigured firewall, which allowed them broader access than intended. The firewall settings had not been updated to reflect recent network changes, creating a vulnerability that the attackers leveraged to move laterally within the network.\nKey Technical Failures: - Firewall Misconfigurations: Outdated rules allowed unauthorized access to internal segments, bypassing typical access controls. - Lateral Movement: Attackers used the compromised credentials to navigate through the network, reaching sensitive systems with minimal detection.\nTechnical Recommendation:\nRegularly auditing firewall rules and configurations is crucial to ensure they align with current network architectures. Automated tools can be used to validate configurations against best practices and flag any anomalies.\n\n3. Data Exfiltration and Lack of Effective Monitoring\nThe attackers’ end goal was data exfiltration, which they achieved by executing large-scale database queries that extracted customer records. The data was then transferred to an external server over encrypted channels, avoiding detection by standard data loss prevention (DLP) tools.\nKey Technical Failures: - Insufficient Monitoring: While CloudCore had monitoring in place, the alerts were not prioritized correctly, leading to delayed detection of unusual database activities. - Data Exfiltration via Encrypted Channels: The use of encrypted channels allowed attackers to evade detection, as standard DLP solutions struggled to inspect encrypted traffic effectively.\nTechnical Recommendation:\nEnhance monitoring capabilities with behavior-based analytics that can detect unusual patterns in database access, even when traditional indicators of compromise are not present. Deploying advanced DLP solutions capable of inspecting encrypted traffic can also mitigate the risk of undetected data exfiltration.\n\nConclusion\nThe CloudCore Networks data breach underscores several critical areas for improvement, from consistent MFA enforcement to better configuration management and more sophisticated monitoring tools. By addressing these technical vulnerabilities, CloudCore and other cloud service providers can significantly reduce their exposure to similar threats in the future. This breach serves as a learning opportunity—an impetus for all organizations to reassess their security postures and take proactive measures against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats."
